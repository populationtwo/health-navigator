For instance, we are supported by reimbursements from managed care organizations and funding from the hospital community benefit programs, private grants, tobacco settlement funds and sales tax revenue. As can be the case, promising programs disappear when an initial grant runs out, which makes braiding all these funding sources\u2014which can be difficult\u2014absolutely necessary to sustain the program over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Creating our approach<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To inform our approach, we worked closely with local hospitals. They were uniquely able to provide referrals but also educate us on what questions (e.g., do you have mold, vermin, cockroaches, etc.) we should be asking of patients.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly learned that the biggest benefit we could provide would be an in-home approach \u2013 you can\u2019t separate someone\u2019s health from the health of the environment they live in. Also, at the time, we spoke with a local doctor who knew her patient\u2019s family was following her recommendations, yet no one was getting better and there were more and more adverse asthma events. Finally, the patient\u2019s mother asked if the attacks could be because of the mushrooms growing in her home. When you hear that story, clearly a light bulb goes off: health is just as much about outside the clinic as inside.<\/p>\n<p>In essence, Asthma Start sends social workers to meet with individuals and families affected by asthma to determine why medication isn\u2019t working. We use social workers because addressing asthma, often, is not just about the disease but is psychosocial as well.<\/p>\n<p>During these home visits, we make sure they have medication and are taking it correctly and outline the most common asthma triggers and how to address them. If needed, we also supply cleaning supplies, ranging from vacuums to dust mite covers to non-bleach-based mold cleaners. We also ask if they have stable housing, jobs, food, a doctor and insurance.<\/p>\n<p>If we identify that a patient requires additional interventions, we can make referrals to our partners at Alameda County\u2019s Health Homes program or other appropriate community resources, programs and organizations. Throughout the years, we have formed deep partnership with many local landlords, our housing authority, the district attorney\u2019s office, schools, the biggest local managed care organization and many others.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Landlords<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Clearly, we knew home triggers and poor living conditions were driving asthma attacks. The trick then is to get these alleviated. So, we sent letters and helped tenants send letters and we got issues addressed, sometimes. Seems simple, but it worked.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Housing Authority<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In those instances where we couldn\u2019t get a landlord to take appropriate action, it was incredibly important to connect with Healthy Homes and our code enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Asthma Start, Healthy Homes and code enforcement meet monthly to conference on the existing cases. We identify the housing issues that are affecting a patient\u2019s health and refer those to Healthy Homes which can, if necessary, work with code enforcement to make sure the poor living conditions are addressed.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>District Attorney and Truancy Court<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our local district attorney found that many parents were in truancy court for chronic absenteeism because they said their children were having asthma attacks and couldn\u2019t make it to school. These weren\u2019t delinquent parents or children\u2014they had legitimate issues.<\/p>\n<p>Once we identified this issue, the district attorney began to refer every family to us that had asthma issues and they would complete our program, and usually start going back to school and never see the truancy court again.<\/p>\n<p>The district attorney also does a training once a year when school starts to help school officials understand chronic absenteeism and how to refer kids to appropriate health services.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Schools<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A lot of school districts have a School Attendance Review Board, which is a board of people who review why folks aren\u2019t making it to school. We sit on many of these boards and if any health issue\u2014asthma or not\u2014is identified, we handle it. We make sure the case follows a similar structure and we get kids back in school. Research indicates that schools\/society save about $40 a day per child that attends. If you take the 30,000 children in the U.S. that are out of school every day due to asthma, you are talking huge cost savings.<\/p>\n<p>Chronic absenteeism is silently crippling the country: missing 10 percent of the school year is a huge risk factor for academic failure and, nationwide, more than one out of 10 students miss that much school every year. Asthma alone accounts for around 14 million absences each year and children with persistent asthma are more than three times as likely to have 10 or more absences than their peers.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Managed Care Organization<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In around 2003, Alameda Alliance of Health (our main Medicaid managed care organization) wanted to leverage our asthma program. First, they had to find a code to pay for our work and found one related to health and behavior assessment.<\/p>\n<p>We signed a contract with a specific amount of money that we had to bill against. This modest, but successful model, worked well for several years. Alliance, about a year ago, decided it might be easier to expand the program and refer all children that are seen in the emergency room to us and the program on a regular basis receives 20 referrals a week\u2014children with asthma-related conditions are referred to Asthma Start, children with other conditions are referred to public health.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this reimbursement, Asthma Start is supported with funding from hospital community benefit programs, private grants, tobacco settlement funds and sales tax revenue. Braiding all of these funding sources together to finance the program isn\u2019t easy, but is necessary to sustain the program over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Results<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think we\u2019ve been so successful because we were the missing link in the continuum of care from the doctor\u2019s office into the home and community. One recent Alliance patient was referred to us \u2013 we saw her at 5 and helped address her asthma. Now, she is 12 and her asthma is a problem again. They were referred to us and immediately the family felt at ease and a conversation started. The problem? Her new allergy medication pill was too big to swallow, so she couldn\u2019t take it. In that one example, we realized part of what we do is just make it okay to talk.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve also saved money, reduced symptoms and improved lives. Our interventions return about $5.00 to $7.00 for each dollar invested. The program has greatly reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations with 95 percent of children maintaining\/reducing their symptoms. And, through these reductions the program has been able to measure a cost savings of up to 50 percent for Alliance.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line: kids are getting to school and living healthier, happier lives due to Asthma Start. And this work is possible and sustainable because we did the difficult work of blending all the diverse funding sources available to us.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/improving-lives-saving-money-by-extending-care-from-the-clinic-into-the-community","date":"2015-11-02T15:15:44","modified":"2015-11-09T14:06:22","format":"standard","slug":"improving-lives-saving-money-by-extending-care-from-the-clinic-into-the-community","guid":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=10180","excerpt":"<p>By\u00a0Brenda Rueda-Yamashita, Chronic Disease Program Director, Alameda County Public Health Department &nbsp; Asthma Start, which delivers in-home case management services, began nearly 14 years ago, when our local health officer wanted to intentionally address and prevent asthma\u2014at the time, Alameda had the third highest rate of asthma in the state.

Karen Meyerson, MSN, APRN, NP-C, AE-C, Manager, Asthma Network of West Michigan<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 1994, a group of concerned health professionals in West Michigan recognized the alarming rise in pediatric asthma morbidity and mortality, locally as well as nationally. Significant disparities are also associated with asthma.\u00a0 For example, asthma deaths in Michigan occur six times more frequently in Black children than in White children.\u00a0 In response, the Asthma Network of West Michigan (ANWM) was formed as a grass-roots coalition with initial funding from the (then) three acute care hospitals and two local foundations.<\/p>\n<p>To reach and improve the lives of the nearly 100,000 people in Western Michigan\u201424 percent of whom are children\u2014who have asthma, ANWM created a direct service arm of its coalition and implemented a home-based asthma case management program for school-aged children who had uncontrolled asthma.\u00a0 ANWM, believed to be the first grassroots asthma coalition in the nation to receive reimbursement for asthma education and case management services from health insurance plans, \u00a0has since expanded its services to adults as well as children under the age of 5.<\/p>\n<p>Our model relies on a few core components: home visits, care conferences and school\/daycare visits and social worker services.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Home Visits<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Research and common sense says that the environment around a child, particularly the home, is an important factor in preventing and controlling asthma. Consequently, a home visit provides the ideal setting to educate, review medication plans, and help families identify environmental factors that may contribute to the severity of asthma. \u00a0If there are issues in the home that are triggering asthma attacks, we connect the family to our partner, the Healthy Homes Coalition, that provides environmental remediation.<\/p>\n<p>To help educate families, we send a certified asthma educator\u2014a nurse (at the RN level) or respiratory therapist (at the RRT level)\u2014into the homes of patients for up to a year to perform environmental assessments and teach them about asthma attack trigger identification and avoidance\/reduction, medications, proper use of devices and other self-management techniques. The asthma educator&#8217;s home visits are typically biweekly for the first three months and then monthly thereafter, as necessary, to provide a continuum of care.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Care Conferences and School\/Daycare Visits<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Care conferences\u2014which are reimbursable visits\u2014are held with the primary care physician and, if indicated, the asthma specialist soon after a new patient enters the program. These conferences tackle issues surrounding adherence, including psychosocial barriers to asthma management and access to care, and elicit a written asthma action plan, if none exists.\u00a0 If necessary, we provide spacers, a device to use with inhalers, to all patients who do not have them.<\/p>\n<p>School\/daycare visits \u2013 also reimbursable visits \u2013 are conducted in order to educate those caring for the children throughout the day about asthma and the child&#8217;s asthma in particular.\u00a0 We share the asthma action plan with staff and discuss asthma triggers in those settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Social Work Services<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we connect patients to our Licensed Masters-level Social Worker&#8217;s services (LMSW), which help families link the clinical recommendations they receive in the hospital or at the doctor&#8217;s office with the social services in their community. This is a vital service because many of our patients and families typically have multiple stressors, ranging from environmental to financial to socio-legal and LMSWs are uniquely capable of identifying and assisting with this range of problems. By blending social support with clinical support, ANWM makes the appropriate referrals or contacts to financial resources, mental health agencies, food banks, hospitals, landlords and others.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Successes<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With this type of intensive, personal care, we have had demonstrated success in controlling asthma and reducing healthcare utilization (including emergency department visits and hospital admissions due to asthma). \u00a0Patients often &#8220;graduate&#8221; from our program after just 6 to 12 months when their asthma control has improved.<\/p>\n<p>When reviewing data over the past 19 years, we find that there have been significant reductions (64 percent) in the number of hospitalizations, days hospitalized for children and emergency department visits (from 60 percent to 35 percent). And, for low-income children with moderate to severe asthma who remained in the original case management study for at least 1 year, we saw an estimated average savings of $1,625 in hospital charges per patient. In total, we estimate the program results in approximately $800 in net healthcare savings per child per year, with a return to society\u2014over two years\u2014of $1.53 for every $1 invested.<\/p>\n<p>We also hear from those we serve. The mother of a 5-year old boy with asthma told us that, &#8220;working with the Asthma Network has really made a big difference \u2013 his asthma is controlled now.\u00a0 They gave me education and made sure that I understood what asthma meant\u2026they made me feel like no one was judging me.&#8221;\u00a0 Mom added, &#8220;I thought he had asthma ONLY when he got sick so I didn&#8217;t give him his inhaler until he had symptoms.\u00a0 If I had never had that education, who knows how many more asthma attacks or emergency room visits he would have?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another important, but perhaps overlooked success, is merely being paid for our services by health insurance plans. Most similar programs aren\u2019t so lucky to receive reimbursement for their hard work.\u00a0 We get reimbursed by Medicaid managed care plans, Medicare and other commercial insurers.\u00a0 We have also been successful in raising grant funds and community benefit funds from local hospitals.\u00a0 It takes a lot of different funding streams, braided and blended together, to support our program, even with the insurance reimbursement. The funding is out there, you just need to spend the time to find it and combine the various streams to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>ANWM owes our success to intentional collaborations with local health insurance plans, hospitals and schools, the people and entities helping patients (public health nurses, physician practices, community clinics, and our local healthcare HUB, Health Net of West Michigan) and our unique ability to blend different funding sources<\/p>\n<p>Because of our success, other Michigan coalitions have formed and begun replicating our model\u2014and they have also been successful in securing payment for similar services in their respective communities.<\/p>\n<p>For more than 20 years we\u2019ve worked hard to prevent adverse asthma events among our most vulnerable populations. \u00a0We wouldn\u2019t have been successful without the network of community resources and funding we\u2019ve been able to marshal \u2013 and the ability, through home visits and social work services, to connect families to those services.\u00a0 Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled.\u00a0 Individuals with asthma should expect nothing less.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/how-an-entire-community-can-come-together-to-help-control-asthma","date":"2015-10-30T16:35:54","modified":"2015-10-30T16:36:15","format":"standard","slug":"how-an-entire-community-can-come-together-to-help-control-asthma","guid":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=10178","excerpt":"<p>By Karen Meyerson, MSN, APRN, NP-C, AE-C, Manager, Asthma Network of West Michigan &nbsp; In 1994, a group of concerned health professionals in West Michigan recognized the alarming rise in pediatric asthma morbidity and mortality, locally as well as nationally.

Justin Mast, RN, BSN, CEN, FAWM, Senior Crisis and Continuity Advisor, MESH<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Seven years ago, Wishard Memorial Hospital, now Eskenazi Health, was one of five organizations to receive a $5 million grant from the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to create innovative public health and healthcare emergency response and management models.<\/p>\n<p>To try something new, Dr. Charles Miramonti, an emergency department physician, looked at relationships, policy and technology. Ultimately, he created a team of healthcare leaders from all of the area\u2019s major hospitals, known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meshcoalition.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">M<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meshcoalition.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">anaged Emergency Surge for Healthcare (MESH) Coalition<\/a>, based in Indianapolis.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, MESH created a framework for sharing resources, a centralized cache of supplies, protocols for coordinated emergency response efforts and training opportunities. All these efforts better centralized preparedness functions across the Central Indiana region.<\/p>\n<p>After building the coalition, marshalling resources and creating efficiencies in public health preparedness, to continue our work, we hosted a work group to focus on disaster planning for children, mothers and expecting mothers.<\/p>\n<p>Quickly, we realized that we had to build community resiliency and that there was a significant vulnerable population that hadn\u2019t been fully addressed when it comes to preparing for emergencies: children who are dependent on electric equipment, most notably ventilators.<\/p>\n<p>During weather events, we found that families with children on ventilators were coming to the emergency room to ensure they would have electricity. They often brought other family members and stayed for the duration of the storm.<\/p>\n<p>To look at the problem, we took three steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Fact finding and research;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Creating a registry of children in the state who are dependent on ventilators; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Writing an <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.meshcoalition.org\/documents\/134\" target=\"_blank\">educational toolkit<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\"> for families and providers (also <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.meshcoalition.org\/documents\/135\" target=\"_blank\">in Spanish<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>First, we wanted to see if there were places other than hospitals that would be able to maintain a power supply during an emergency. It would be beneficial to the entire community to keep people out of the hospital if they didn\u2019t need urgent care at that moment\u2014as long as we could safeguard their health.<\/p>\n<p>We spoke with emergency personal in every county to get a sense of what resources existed and what needs there were\u2014we needed to know if it was possible to give families another location they could go to during an emergency. Ultimately, we developed a database that includes 181 power safe facilities with nearly two locations for every county.<\/p>\n<p>While having the alternate locations mapped was great, they would only be helpful if we could identify and inform the families that would need to use them. So, we built a HIPAA compliant registry that parents can use to register their ventilator-dependent children.<\/p>\n<p>The third piece of the puzzle was informing and educating families and responders. We wanted to give families tools to connect with local resources because it\u2019s far easier\u2014in more rural areas\u2014to get to those places during an emergency. We also wanted to empower families to reach out to these services and personnel, which would make the connections even stronger.<\/p>\n<p>So, we created tools, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/meshcoalition\/review\/102527961\/7460b68573\" target=\"_blank\">video<\/a> (also <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/meshcoalition\/review\/102527962\/6ec9037bf9\" target=\"_blank\">in Spanish<\/a>), to educate families on how weather could impact the power supply their children depended on.\u00a0The toolkit includes draft letters families can send to authorities\u2014such as EMS and fire\u2014to let them know in advance there is an electrically dependent patient in the household.<\/p>\n<p>We then gave the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meshcoalition.org\/documents\/134\" target=\"_blank\">toolkit<\/a> to hospital nurses to pass along to families at discharge.\u00a0And, throughout the development, we partnered with the Indiana Emergency Medical Services for Children (IEMSC), Indiana State Department of Health and other partners whom were instrumental in creating the toolkit and spreading the resources across the state.<\/p>\n<p>We also worked with medical equipment providers and let them know that there are resources for families. They were extremely happy to provide information on the toolkit and registry to their patients.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to believe that just five years ago each individual Central Indiana hospital and healthcare facility prepared to face a public health emergency on its own\u2014completely apart from the other resources, infrastructure and partners, just down the road.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the MESH Coalition is helping providers prepare for and respond to emergency events and communities remain viable and resilient through recovery.<\/p>\n<p>We know that, by forging these innovative partners, we have saved millions of dollars on redundant equipment and emergency supplies. Through all of these efforts, the MESH Coalition is building resilience in the healthcare sector and improving everyday life for Hoosiers.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/mesh-community-resilience","date":"2015-06-04T03:12:07","modified":"2015-06-11T16:57:21","format":"standard","slug":"mesh-community-resilience","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=9290","excerpt":"<p>By Justin Mast, RN, BSN, CEN, FAWM, Senior Crisis and Continuity Advisor, MESH &nbsp; Seven years ago, Wishard Memorial Hospital, now Eskenazi Health, was one of five organizations to receive a $5 million grant from the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to create innovative public health and healthcare emergency response and management models.

Rebecca Ramsey, BSN, MPH,\u00a0Director &#8211; Community Care, CareOregon<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For years, CareOregon\u2014 a non-profit\u00a0health plan\u00a0serving the healthcare needs of low-income Oregonians\u2014used more traditional means (telephonic case management predominantly) to reach our population. However, there was a segment that we were unable to engage with optimally or even at all. To expand our reach to underserved portions of our population, we built a partnership with our primary care network that was designed to implement primary care home team-based models within our safety net network.<\/p>\n<p>With these limited, but incredibly important, experiences, we improved chronic disease management and access to preventive care; built more data driven process; brought behavioral health consultants on the team; and expanded our capacity to reach different populations. However, we still didn\u2019t quite get there \u2013 the high cost and very complex patients remained elusive.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time as this partnership was reaching our sixth year, managed care plans were experiencing significant cuts. We knew we had to do more with less. To accomplish this, we had to take chances and try something completely different.<\/p>\n<p>So, a medical director and I performed a few site visits of similar organizations that seemed to be thriving in the changing culture and reaching high cost patients. These places had more experience performing community-based outreach to their most vulnerable members\/patients and we wanted to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Through these visits, we spent time with mobile outreach teams that were conducting home visits and talked with leaders and administrators.<\/p>\n<p>The whole trip was one long eureka moment. The minute we were back, we knew we needed to partner in a different way with our primary care network and develop a different model of care management, which would really be a new vulnerable population strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The strategy revolved around helping the primary care teams in clinics with high cost members expand their team to include a new workforce that had the ability to work outside the clinic walls and meet patients where they lived and where they were struggling.<\/p>\n<p>We began the plan with data \u2013 we looked through tons and tons of claims data to identify members who were frequently admitted to the Emergency Department and\/or Hospital, and we began this new work with two clinics that had a high proportion of these members.<\/p>\n<p>We identified a cohort of members in these two clinics and did chart reviews, talked with providers and made home visits to interview them \u2013 all of which supported our conclusion that we needed to reach these folks via different means. We found that these patients were going to the clinic, but there was so much psychosocial risk in their daily lives that couldn\u2019t be managed within an office setting\u2014and this was certainly impacting their health.<\/p>\n<p>We then recruited \u00a0two outreach workers to go out into the community and work with high-risk patients. We hired individuals with amazing engagement skills, social justice understanding, compassion, exceptional interpersonal skills and extensive knowledge of vulnerable populations.<\/p>\n<p>Somewhat surprisingly, our first two hires ended up being masters-level social workers who really liked the innovative idea of integrating their work right into primary care and doing community outreach. While they were health plan employees, they were embedded in the clinics \u2013 but they could also liaise back with us.<\/p>\n<p>We called our new staff Community Outreach Workers and they immediately began to engage with a small panel of high-cost, very complex individuals. Specifically, they conducted care planning and individual outreach that was completely client-centered\u2014meeting with individuals in shelters, homes, emergency departments, hospitals, etc.<\/p>\n<p>They worked intentionally and methodically with each patient to identify what their barriers to health were. They found that there were mild cognitive impairments, developmental disabilities, health literacy issues, housing instability, childhood trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, addiction, etc. It was what we were expecting but at a far larger magnitude.<\/p>\n<p>After the interventions began, we saw hospital and emergency department utilization decrease. Of course, the providers were happy. But they also noticed that patients would interact differently during their visits and seemed more engaged and receptive within the clinic\u2019s walls.<\/p>\n<p>The pilot lasted about nine months and the results were great. We had clinics lining up to participate in the next round. At about the same time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the innovation awards (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation) and our community decided to apply for one, which we received. Our plan was to do what our clinics were clamoring for: to expand the community outreach worker model along with four other interwoven programs to create a cross continuum safety net for this population.<\/p>\n<p>The last aspect of our success that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked: our model relies on principles of trauma informed care**. We were blown away by how prevalent the experience of childhood and lifetime trauma was in our patients. We feel far more informed now and primary care is shifting the culture with this understanding. Within our local community, people are now paying attention in a new way at the root causes for these members poor health.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, we have 17 community outreach workers, now known as Health Resilience Specialists, in 17 clinics and we are seeing 34 percent declines in hospital and emergency department utilization. We\u2019re in the process of developing a control group to obtain more specific results. If the results hold, we could see savings of between $3.7 and $7.4 million per year. At the current scale, the program costs us $2.5 million per year.<\/p>\n<p>As far as I know, this is the first time that, as a health plan, we have partnered with our networks in such a collaborative way. For many years, payers tried to run these programs for members at high risk\u2014with limited results. What we learned is that we have to collaborate intensively with the entire continuum of care. I think the reason we\u2019re seeing astounding results is because of the partnership and because the staff are integrated.<\/p>\n<p>__________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>**TFAH\/Editor\u2019s note on trauma informed care<\/strong>: The most common social risk factor in CareOregon\u2019s target population is trauma, which clearly strained interpersonal relationships, made self-care difficult and lead to misunderstood behavior patterns. To truly reach this population, CareOregon first sought to understand trauma and the ramifications of experiencing traumatic events. CareOregon then implemented a nationally recognized, evidence-based Trauma Informed Care model called the Sanctuary Model\u2122. Staff and clinics were encouraged to avoid being hierarchical and to motivate patients so they had a stake in their own care. In practice, trauma-informed principles influenced each member and provider interaction.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/health-resilience-specialists-the-key-to-providing-quality-care-to-high-risk-patients","date":"2014-11-18T05:35:29","modified":"2015-06-02T18:02:12","format":"standard","slug":"health-resilience-specialists-the-key-to-providing-quality-care-to-high-risk-patients","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=8575","excerpt":"<p>By Rebecca Ramsey, BSN, MPH,\u00a0Director &#8211; Community Care, CareOregon &nbsp; For years, CareOregon\u2014 a non-profit\u00a0health plan\u00a0serving the healthcare needs of low-income Oregonians\u2014used more traditional means (telephonic case management predominantly) to reach our population.

of Ob\/Gyn and Medicine, Biological Sciences Division, University of Chicago; Director, Research and Innovation, Urban Health Initiative, University of Chicago Medicine; and Director, CommunityRx<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">___________________________________________________________<\/span><\/p>\n<p>CommunityRx began with a search for health and wellness resources on Chicago\u2019s South Side. We knew our communities have a lot to offer, but locating these assets wasn\u2019t easy. Programs and services were hard to find, and information about them was often confusing. Often times it was simply wrong. We wondered what happened when patients left a clinic or hospital. Could they find what they needed to be healthy \u2013 or were community places and services invisible to them?<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, our lab at the University of Chicago received a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Health Care Innovation Award to develop a real-time automated system that links patients with up-to-date information about community-based services and resources that can help them stay healthy and manage their conditions. CommunityRx creates a customized referral list for community-based services, called a Health<em>eRx<\/em>, and connects patients to a community health information specialist who can help with navigating to community resources. Currently, most people receive a Health<em>eRx<\/em> through one of 20 participating clinical sites, including community health centers, emergency departments, and University of Chicago clinics. But, anyone with an internet connection can generate a Health<em>eRx<\/em> at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.healtherx.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.healtherx.org<\/a> or by contacting one of our information specialists. There are three core, complementary components to the CommunityRx system:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">MAPSCorps<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Health<em>eRx<\/em><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Community Health Information Specialists<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>MAPSCorps<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MAPSCorps began in 2008 when researchers with the <a href=\"http:\/\/uhi.uchospitals.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Health Initiative<\/a> at the University of Chicago engaged with local community leaders and residents to identify how to work together in applying the tools of science to improve local urban health. Community leaders voiced that a partnership would need to engage local youth, include economic vitality in the definition of health and produce meaningful data that community businesses, organizations and residents could use.<\/p>\n<p>From these imperatives emerged MAPSCorps (Meaningful, Active, Productive Science in Service to Community), a STEM-education and youth employment program that trains local high school students to map businesses and organizations on the South Side of Chicago. Every summer since 2009, local high school students generate a comprehensive census of all public-facing businesses and organizations offering goods or services within target neighborhoods. Using a \u201cfeet-on-the-street\u201d methodology and a custom phone app called \u201cMapApp,\u201d we found that the data collected by MAPSCorps are 20 to 40 percent more accurate than widely used data sources.[1]<\/p>\n<p>MAPSCorps pairs the high school youth with science-oriented college students who expose mappers to a science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) curriculum, and help them learn important skills that prepare them for future education and jobs. Since 2009, we have provided more than 350 meaningful jobs for local youth who have mapped almost 90 sq. miles of Chicago\u2019s South Side. We have received more than 80 formal requests for the MAPSCorps data, which are made available to researchers, community organizations and others interested via the South Side Health and Vitality Studies Data Request Form<a href=\"https:\/\/redcap.uchicago.edu\/surveys\/?s=c5MeaU\" target=\"_blank\"> here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health<em>eRx<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MAPSCorps also serves as the data engine for Health<em>eRx<\/em>, an e-prescribing technology embedded into electronic medical record (EMR) systems and seamlessly integrated into the normal clinical workflow. The system matches each patient\u2019s health information from the EMR with self-care programs and services located near their home. In the same way that doctors can easily e-prescribe drugs, the CommunityRx system prescribes \u201ceverything else\u201d that patients can use for wellness, independent living and disease management.<\/p>\n<p>Health<em>eRx<\/em> fuels an information economy on the South Side by providing real-time, up-to-date data on community needs and assets. The data generated through Health<em>eRx <\/em>are shared back with community-based organizations in the form of Service Provider Data reports, allowing community leaders to understand the number of referrals made to specific services offered by their organizations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Community Health Information Specialists<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The third component, Community Health Information Specialists, provides the \u201chuman touch.\u201d Each Health<em>eRx<\/em> features a picture and contact information for the Information Specialist \u2014 a special type of community health worker who helps the patient navigate the services to which they are referred\u2014assigned to that patient\u2019s zip code.<\/p>\n<p>Information Specialists regularly call local businesses and organizations identified by MAPSCorps to gather detailed information on the programs and services they offer. By regularly interacting with community-based service providers, Information Specialists are well-positioned to help patients navigate and understand the available health and self-care services printed on the Health<em>eRx.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CommunityRx currently operates in 20 clinical sites, including four health care provider organizations using three different EMR systems. Since April 1, 2013, more than 100,000 Health<em>eRx<\/em>s have been generated for more than 40,000 unique patients.<\/p>\n<p>Through a voluntary participant call-in survey, we found that about half of patients are sharing the information they get from the Health<em>eRx<\/em> with friends or family\u2014and 100 percent of people who share the information report saying something positive about Health<em>eRx<\/em>. One patient shared, \u201cI told my friend to call Pamela [an Information Specialist] because she needs help with a lot of things on here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tim Long, MD, a doctor on Chicago\u2019s South Side said \u201c\u2026I need Health<em>eRx<\/em>. This new kind of \u2018prescription\u2019 goes beyond a diagnosis and medicine.

Al Bradley, Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency, Nancy M. Bennett, MD, Center for Community Health, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For the past nine years, the Rochester Business Alliance (RBA) \u2013 the chamber of commerce for the Rochester, New York\/Finger Lakes region \u2013 has taken an active role in healthcare issues. The region\u2019s largest employers formed the Health Care Planning Team to formulate strategies that would improve health and reduce costs. They were instrumental in implementing a community-wide employee wellness program, \u201cEat Well Live Well,\u201d to encourage physical activity and consumption of fruits and vegetables; and were a primary driver in the launch of the regional health information organization (RHIO), one of the highest performing RHIOs in the country.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, the Health Care Planning Team began to explore projects that would promote greater change across the community, accelerate that change, address specific conditions that community data indicated were consistent challenges, and expand participation. After further analysis as well as multiple key informant interviews, the team decided to focus on high blood pressure. An estimated 30 percent of American adults suffer from high blood pressure; national control rates are far below desired targets; and failure to gain control can lead to devastating outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010 the Health Care Planning Team forged a partnership with the Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency (FLHSA) to create the FLHSA\/RBA High Blood Pressure Collaborative, which includes all major local healthcare systems, the business community, community-based organizations, the faith community, physician groups and insurers, to collectively formulate a multi-faceted set of interventions anchored in Wagner\u2019s model of chronic care.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the deliberately diverse nature of the collaborative, it was natural to focus interventions on a variety of aspects (healthcare, worksite, and community). The collaborative specifically designed multi-faceted initiatives that would promote behavior change, improve adherence to care plans, and increase self-management of health.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Measurement of Practice and Community Performance<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Representatives of the collaborative approached the major local health systems, Federally Qualified Health Centers and larger primary care groups to request sharing of high blood pressure patient data. All were eager and willing to participate in this important initiative. Two times per year, these partners submit de-identified data to healthcare analysts at the Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency. These data include information on all patients identified by a problem list or ICD-9 code as having high blood pressure. The data also include the most recent blood pressure reading, from which analysts calculate control rates across demographic variables, co-morbidities and socio-economic status. The metrics that emerge are shared with practices that submitted the data and enable comparison across the community and identification of patients for further attention.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Healthcare System Change<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Patient care in the clinical setting remains at the center of chronic disease management. Practice reports illustrate for clinicians their practice\u2019s performance including metrics that demonstrate their own performance compared to the entire community. The reports also include recommendations to improve control rates, drawn from the evidence base and experience. The data are further used by a team of \u201cpractice improvement consultants\u201d \u2013community clinicians trained in an academic detailing model \u2013 who serve as resources to help formulate and implement strategies to improve practice control rates. These strategies include effective use of registries, aggressive patient follow-up and close adherence to guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>A key evolving component of primary care transformation involves practice teams where all staff are empowered to participate in care. Blood Pressure Advocates, trained and supervised by the Center for Community Health, follow a community health worker model and are embedded in practices that have a large number of low income and\/or Medicaid patients. The advocates work with the clinical team to identify patients in need of help in blood pressure control, and provide peer-to-peer counseling including education about high blood pressure and healthy behaviors.\u00a0 The advocates also seek to help patients identify and address the key barriers to their blood pressure control. They then share these barriers with clinicians and work together to address them. As members of the patients\u2019 communities, the advocates have knowledge of local resources that can further help in reaching blood pressure control, physical activity and nutrition goals.<\/p>\n<p>In one example, a patient met with the advocate, who found that the patient didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for the co-pays on three different blood pressure medicines and was having difficulty remembering to take the medicines on schedule. The advocate worked with the clinician to revise the treatment plan to a single prescription that the patient only had to take once a day, which also cut copays. \u00a0From then on, the patient was much more adherent and his blood pressure was well-controlled.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Worksite Health Change<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A workgroup of employee wellness experts developed an online worksite wellness index, adapted from a similar CDC tool, to evaluate and improve workplace environments and policies and to provide information on local wellness resources. This team of experts further acts as a resource to smaller employers seeking to implement wellness programs.<\/p>\n<p>Eighty different worksites have completed the index and most report that they are in the process of adopting changes that the index helped identify. These worksites will be encouraged to complete the index again after approximately one year to assess improvements. The lessons learned will be further disseminated to provide a forum for information and strategy sharing.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, one local grocery store chain is deploying pharmacists to provide counseling for their own employees on blood pressure management. Participants have demonstrated improved blood pressure control, weight loss, and are highly engaged. This model is being piloted with other employers.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Community Health Change<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the community level, some of the biggest impediments to blood pressure control are awareness and motivation. To better educate and mobilize those with high blood pressure, the collaborative implemented the Blood Pressure Ambassador Program.<\/p>\n<p>Blood Pressure Ambassadors are partnered with organizations including churches, barber shops, beauty salons, community based organizations and nursing schools. As fellow congregants or constituents, ambassadors are able to establish a high level of trust to increase success in helping promote desired changes in self-management. Ambassadors are provided with tools, resources and training by the collaborative to effectively reach people over a sustained period of time. To promote overall awareness and to increase the number of people who know they have high blood pressure, ambassadors also conduct screening events across a broad spectrum of community venues.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Outcomes of a Communitywide Initiative<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The multi-faceted set of initiatives has demonstrated results in improving blood pressure control. Registry data from December 2010 showed a community control rate of 62.7 percent. In December 2013 the control rate improved to 71.3 percent. Ultimately the collaborative will seek to demonstrate improvements in the incidence of cardiovascular events and kidney failure that are often linked to poor blood pressure control.<\/p>\n<p>The key to the success of the Rochester High Blood Pressure Collaborative lies in the ongoing commitment of over 160 individuals from 67 organizations. Collaborative partner forces have come together to take on a common goal. This model can be replicated to take on other health challenges in the future.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/community-wide-effort-improves-blood-pressure-control","date":"2014-09-17T03:00:38","modified":"2015-06-02T18:10:03","format":"standard","slug":"community-wide-effort-improves-blood-pressure-control","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=8453","excerpt":"<p>By Al Bradley, Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency, Nancy M.

DR. ROSE GOWEN, MD, Commissioner\u00a0At-large, Brownsville, Texas<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH-2014-ObesityReport-Brownsville.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Access a PDF of the story with graphics and photos here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In 2000, the University of Texas School of Public Health placed a satellite campus in Brownsville, a largely Latino city on the Texas-Mexican border. Researchers set to work\u2014identifying the health risks our community faced and designing creative solutions for our unique population.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers found that 80 percent of Brownsville residents were overweight or obese and one-third were diabetic\u2014half of those people didn\u2019t even know they had diabetes. One of the first things the research team did in response was launch \u201cTu Salud Si Cuenta,\u201d a Spanish-language program on local TV and radio stations. Dr. Belinda Reininger, an assistant professor at the School of Public Health developed the program. She understood the importance of educating people about their health, but she also knew she and her team had to do more.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Dr. McCormick, dean of the Brownsville campus invited me to participate in their efforts. He and his team believed it was critical to involve clinicians in public health. At the time, I was a practicing physician and the day I met Dr. McCormick my public health education began.<\/p>\n<p>I started by writing a weekly column in the newspaper. \u00a0I wrote about playing outside at my grandmother\u2019s house when I was a kid and the healthy meals she\u2019d cook for us\u2014activities that had fallen by the wayside with time.\u00a0 I challenged community leaders to make sidewalks and bicycle trails a priority instead of building tollways. The column captured attention and the community began to listen and learn.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cultivating Access to Healthy Foods<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We also backed our words with action. Dr. Reininger suggested starting a farmers\u2019 market to help make fresh fruits and vegetables more affordable and accessible. We looked at examples of successful farmers\u2019 markets as we considered where to locate; what shoppers would purchase; and how to attract growers. Our goal was to create a certified Texas farmers\u2019 market in a city park, which meant navigating a great deal of \u201cred tape\u201d and securing a modest amount of funding.<\/p>\n<p>When Su Clinica, a local Federally Qualified Health Center, wrote the Brownsville Farmers\u2019 Market into a grant to reduce obesity, we launched the market. That grant allowed us to create a voucher program to entice people to try the produce. Community workers distributed vouchers that could be redeemed at the farmer\u2019s market to schools, homeless shelters, wound care centers, and other places to reach those most at risk. Opening day was embraced by all and we sold fifty dozen farm eggs in thirty minutes!\u00a0 The market has been very successful, now operates year long, and has spawned the creation of two sister markets in neighboring cities.<\/p>\n<p>Our wellness coalition then started a community garden program, which was sparked by a grower who received a grant for mentoring and developing neighborhood gardens.<\/p>\n<p>To help launch the \u201cTres Angeles\u201d garden, <em>promotoras<\/em> went door-to-door in the Buena Vida neighborhood. Interest was huge: plots sold for $15 a season and sold out fast. Our gardeners have not only been able to feed themselves, they also sell the excess at the farmers\u2019 market and earn $200 a week.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big deal in a neighborhood where the average monthly income is $400.<\/p>\n<p>A second garden is now in place, a third is being built, and a fourth is being planned. The gardens are in low-income areas spread throughout the city.\u00a0 They are supervised, include nutrition education programs, and have replaced empty lots with welcoming gathering spaces filled with smiles and hope.\u00a0 This initiative is not just about health and nutrition; it is very much about economic and community building.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Helping People Be More Active<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition to helping people eat healthier, we also needed to make it as easy as possible for them to be active. This was challenging because in many parts of the city, sidewalks were nonexistent, in disrepair or disconnected. Kids who were only a block or two from school had to take a bus each day because their streets were not safe for walking or biking.<\/p>\n<p>We passed complete streets, sidewalk, and safe-passing ordinances. Then we began a Build a Better Block Project (BBB). The BBB concept involves turning a block into an optimal version of itself\u2014wide sidewalks, street lights, bicycle lanes, engaging storefronts\u2014for a day.\u00a0 The idea is to let people \u201ctry it on for size.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At first, we chose a block downtown in need of revitalization. To prepare for BBB, the School of Public Health\u2019s dietician worked with restaurants to develop healthier options and streets were transformed into pedestrian-only spaces.\u00a0 Businesses on the block and even those several blocks away saw increased foot traffic and earned more money in one day than they usually do in a month.<\/p>\n<p>We looked further at the built environment and designed the Belden Trail. By using grants and leveraging additional funds from the city, community and national foundations, we turned a dangerous alleyway into a well-lit mile-long concrete path that connects several schools in a low-income neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest lesson we\u2019ve learned about addressing health among the Latino community in Brownsville is that we can\u2019t just talk about health. We have to explain how good health benefits all. Healthy children are happier and do better in school.

Management, Molina Healthcare, Inc.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">As one of the largest family participating Hispanic-owned business in the United States, Molina Healthcare \u2014 which serves Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, Marketplace and dual eligible plans \u2014 has always viewed its mission as reaching and providing quality well and preventive care to traditionally underserved Americans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One ongoing challenge in health care is getting members to understand and follow doctors\u2019 orders. For some low-income members with multiple medical problems, lack of adherence to a treatment plan can lead to a rapid decline in their health, excessive use of the Emergency Department and extra costs. Many times the root of the issue of non-adherence is not addressed.<\/p>\n<p>For these members, Molina Healthcare has found an effective solution: Community Connectors. \u00a0Community Connectors may serve as liaisons between patients and clinicians and take a personal approach to assessing needs and assisting the treatment team with coordinating members care. Working one-on-one, they coach members to self-manage their chronic conditions, connect them to community resources and advocate on their behalf. Community Connectors are thoroughly familiar with the community and the available resources that can help members improve or maintain their health.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, at Molina\u2019s health plan in New Mexico, where we launched the program a decade ago, we began by using our health care utilization database to identify members who frequently visited the Emergency Department, abused controlled substances, or received fragmented care, which may have resulted in poorly controlled chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and asthma.<\/p>\n<p>We tasked the Community Connectors with reaching this underserved group, and quickly found that the initial challenge was simply locating these members. One of the primary reasons for being unable to locate a member is when the member does not report a change in residence. This causes their billing\/location data to become inaccurate.<\/p>\n<p>Our original focus was providing education on managing health, connecting members to traditional health-related social services and advocating for them within the appropriate health systems. However, we quickly learned that we had to find basic community resources to help members meet their essential needs of life (food, shelter and safety) first and then focus on the other \u201ctraditional\u201d health issues.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when depression and pain sent Molina member Rose to the Emergency Department for the fifth time in three months, she was referred to Thomas, a Community Connector. He visited Rose at her home, where she told him about drug deals, bomb threats, arson and a murder that had all taken place in her apartment complex. Thomas researched Rose\u2019s statements about her apartment complex and found that every one of them was true.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas was able to find Rose new Section 8 housing in a different city closer to her provider, and also obtained a donated laptop in which she could connect to the internet at her local senior center. Now in a safe, comfortable home, Rose pays her bills online, keeps regular doctor appointments, leads an active social life, loves crocheting hats that are donated to the homeless and hasn\u2019t been back to the Emergency Department.<\/p>\n<p>Another member named Michael had COPD, heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, depression and malnutrition. Aggravating all these conditions were his painful, ill-fitting dentures that caused sores to form on his gums and kept him up at night. Michael had called Molina\u2019s member services team to complain that he was unable to get new dentures, but then didn\u2019t return his case manager\u2019s follow-up letters or calls in response to his complaint. Michael was assigned to a Community Connector who coordinated calls between Michael\u2019s dental clinic and Molina\u2019s prior authorization department. By coordinating communication between Michael, the dental clinic and Molina\u2019s authorization department, the Community Connector was able to resolve an administrative issue. Michael now has a new smile, is able to eat nutritious meals and feels healthier in every way. There are many more stories just like these.<\/p>\n<p>Community Connectors are an extension of case management and the interdisciplinary care team in all 11 states where Molina operates health plans. In each one, Community Connectors have served to improve access to preventive and primary care for our members, enhance their health and reduce their use of the Emergency Department, along with decreasing associated hospital costs.<\/p>\n<p>In New Mexico, the program has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21953498\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated<\/a> savings of $4,564 per enrollee and reduced emergency department use, days of inpatient care and drug abuse. There was also a significant reduction in numbers of claims and payments after the Community Connector intervention.<\/p>\n<p>One study of our model, which looked at costs from six-months before to six-months after the intervention, found lowered costs in emergency department usage, inpatient care, non-narcotics prescriptions and narcotics prescriptions.<\/p>\n<p>We believe the model is so successful because it\u2019s a win-win. It\u2019s a win for the members because they have improved health outcomes and a better quality of life. And, it\u2019s a win for Molina because we are decreasing health care costs. We\u2019ve seen in meeting with our members that traditional health care can only go so far. We value the importance of meeting members where they live to truly see the barriers they face in achieving healthy lifestyles. With this knowledge, we can provide the type of care that will improve and maintain health. We\u2019re proud to bring this kind of personalized program to more members all the time \u2014 while we support the company mission of helping those who need it most.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/community-connectors-the-missing-link-to-providing-high-quality-healthcare","date":"2014-09-04T08:09:22","modified":"2015-06-02T18:11:22","format":"standard","slug":"community-connectors-the-missing-link-to-providing-high-quality-healthcare","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=8366","excerpt":"<p>By

of the story with graphics and photos here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When my son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I became painfully aware of the direct connection between food and health. As a chef, this realization caused me to transform the way I fed my family and customers. Fresh, nutrient-dense, locally grown foods became the foundation for the type of diet that would give my son and restaurant guests the best long-term health.<\/p>\n<p>Quickly, though, I recognized that not every family can afford to purchase healthy foods. As a result, I founded <a href=\"http:\/\/wholesomewave.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wholesome Wave<\/a> in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>Wholesome Wave is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to making healthy, locally and regionally grown food affordable to everyone, regardless of income. We work collaboratively with underserved communities, nonprofits, farmers, farmers\u2019 markets, healthcare providers, and government entities to form networks that improve health, increase fruit and vegetable consumption and generate revenue for small and mid-sized farms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Double Value Coupon Program<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2008, we launched the Double Value Coupon Program (DVCP), a network of more than 50 nutrition incentive programs operated at 305 farmers markets in 24 states and DC. The program provides customers with a monetary incentive when they spend their federal nutrition benefits at participating farmers markets. The incentive matches the amount spent and can be used to purchase healthy, fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n<p>Farmers and farmers\u2019 markets benefit from this approach, and have been key allies as we work towards federal and local policy change.\u00a0 In 2013, federal nutrition benefits and DVCP incentives accounted for $2.45 million in sales at farmers\u2019 markets.<\/p>\n<p>Communities also see an increase in economic activity.\u00a0 The $2.45 million spent at local farmers\u2019 markets creates a significant ripple effect. In addition to the dollars spent at markets, almost one-third of DVCP consumers said they planned to spend an average of nearly $30 at nearby businesses on market day, resulting in more than $1 million spent at local businesses. We also see that the demographics of market participants are more diverse &#8211; our approach breaks down social barriers and allows consumers who receive federal benefits to be seen as critical participants in local economies.<\/p>\n<p>Equally as important, people are eating healthier. Our 2011 Diet and Behavior Shopping Study indicated 90 percent of DVCP consumers increased or greatly increased their consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables \u2013 a behavior change that continues well after market season ends.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the program reaches more than 35,800 participants and their families and impacts more than 3,500 farmers. Combined with the new Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentives Program in the latest Farm Bill, this approach is now being scaled up with $100 million allocated for nutrition incentives over five years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We developed the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program (FVRx) to measure health outcomes linked to fruit and vegetable consumption. The four to six month program is designed to provide assistance to overweight and obese children who are affected by diet-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. In 2013, the program impacted 1,288 children and adults in 5 states and DC. Nearly two-thirds of the participants are enrolled in SNAP and roughly a quarter receive WIC benefits.<\/p>\n<p>The model works within the normal doctor-patient relationship.\u00a0 During the visit, the doctor writes a prescription for produce that the patient\u2019s family can redeem at participating farmers\u2019 markets. The prescription includes at least one serving of produce per day for each patient and each family member \u2013 i.e., a family of four would receive $28 per week to spend on produce. In addition to the prescription, there are follow-up monthly meetings with the practitioner and a nutritionist to provide guidance and support for healthy eating, and to measure fruit and vegetable consumption.\u00a0 Other medical follow-ups are performed, including tracking body mass index (BMI).<\/p>\n<p>FVRx improves the health of participants. Forty-two percent of child participants saw a decrease in their BMI and 55 percent of participants increased their fruit and vegetable consumption by an average of two cups. In addition, families reported a significant increase in household food security.<\/p>\n<p>Each dollar invested in the program provides healthier foods for participants, boosts income for small and mid-sized farms and supports the overall health of the community. As with the DVCP, there are benefits for producers and communities.\u00a0 In 2012 alone, FVRx brought in $120,000 in additional revenue for the 26 participating markets.<\/p>\n<p>In less than seven years, Wholesome Wave has extended its reach to 25 states and DC and is working with more than 60 community-based organizations, community healthcare centers in six states, two hospital systems, and many others. Our work proves that increasing access to affordable healthy food is a powerful social equalizer, health improver, economic driver and community builder.<\/p>\n<p>Wholesome Wave is working to change the world we eat in. As the number of on-the-ground partners increases, we get closer to a more equitable food system for everyone.\u00a0 This means healthier citizens and communities, and a more vibrant economy nationwide.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/improving-the-health-of-communities-by-increasing-access-to-affordable-locally-grown-foods","date":"2014-09-04T08:08:44","modified":"2015-06-02T18:11:27","format":"standard","slug":"improving-the-health-of-communities-by-increasing-access-to-affordable-locally-grown-foods","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=8325","excerpt":"<p>BY MICHEL NISCHAN, CEO and Founder,\u00a0Wholesome Wave Access a PDF of the story with graphics and photos here.

of the story with graphics and photos here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When I started Georgetowne Home Preschool in Ocala, Florida 20 years ago, I was more than 100 pounds overweight and had little understanding of how important eating healthy was to happiness, health, and success.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised with poor nutritional habits in a poor family\u2014we seemingly didn\u2019t have the money or the information we needed to buy healthy foods.<\/p>\n<p>This all changed when I started to take care of other people\u2019s children. Part of my preparation for becoming a child care provider included reviewing an incredibly helpful nutrition curriculum and additional healthy eating information supplied by the state of Florida. I started to realize the importance of diverse and healthy foods. As I began practicing good nutrition, my eating habits changed and my activity levels improved dramatically. I lost 100 pounds as a result.<\/p>\n<p>I had to bring this good feeling to my kids. I joined Florida\u2019s Child Care Food Program (CCFP) to help these children eat healthy and improve their overall learning skills. Thankfully, our state\u2019s nutrition standards are quite strong\u2014for more than a decade, CCFP has limited sugary foods and drinks and has required fruit and vegetables at breakfast and snack time.<\/p>\n<p>Florida\u2019s efforts were ahead of its time! In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required the USDA to develop standards for Child and Adult Food Program meals that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This new national standard will help preschools in other states with less rigorous standards than Florida\u2019s. I guarantee that once preschools fully buy into providing nutritious meals and snacks, their children will be happier, healthier and more productive.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we need to ensure kids buy into this concept of eating healthy. When some parents bring me their little four-year-olds, they say things like \u201cmy son is a picky eater. He only eats mac \u2018n cheese or chicken nuggets and doesn\u2019t like fruits or vegetables.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Quite frankly, I think we underestimate a child\u2019s ability to adapt and willingness to explore. For example, when I start teaching and working with the children, I show them a plate and say, \u201clet\u2019s put a lima bean on there.\u201d If they say they don\u2019t want it, I turn it into a fun adventure and tap into their imagination. I get out the magnifying glasses and have them check their tongues for the \u201clima bean taste bud\u201d or tell them it will give them superpowers\u2014which, when you think about the health benefits of fruits and vegetables, isn\u2019t so far off. They love it! Sure enough, an adventurous and <em>tough<\/em> four-year-old volunteers and the rest follow suit \u2013 and soon everyone is eating lima beans and other fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n<p>We make all of our own food on site with the kids. The children smell and touch and interact with foods. We put up pictures of fruits and vegetables they\u2019ve never seen before. And then we set up a \u201cgrocery store\u201d in the kitchen and the kids go shopping and pretend to buy these things.<\/p>\n<p>Typical days also include as much physical activity as possible, including stretching, dancing, playing, bike riding, and swimming. And, of course, we focus on learning from start to finish, with kindergarten preparatory assignments, computer work, 3-D projects, or dramatic play (acting out grocery store shopping, for instance) and group action games on our circle time rug.<\/p>\n<p>People always want to know how all this is possible on a tight budget. First, I serve everything family style, which teaches responsibility and gives me the opportunity to introduce foods at the right pace and portion size for each child.\u00a0 I also shop at warehouses and roadside stands and avoid canned foods \u2013 buying fresh or frozen is typically healthier and tastes better, too.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found that my parents are highly supportive of this approach\u2014they appreciate what it means for their kids, and have been inspired to eat healthier at home as well<\/p>\n<p>Our emphasis on nutrition is the foundation on which our success has been built. It\u2019s all about giving children the tools and skills they need to make healthy choices and grow up healthy.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/good-nutrition-is-key-to-a-good-start-for-children","date":"2014-09-04T08:07:00","modified":"2015-06-02T17:31:01","format":"standard","slug":"good-nutrition-is-key-to-a-good-start-for-children","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=8330","excerpt":"<p>BY DEBRA POOLE, owner, Georgetowne\u00a0Home Preschool Access a PDF of the story with graphics and photos here.

It\u2019s\u00a0also important to note that our care\u00a0team includes a psychologist, social\u00a0worker, registered dietician, diabetes\u00a0educator, pharmacist, and an exercise\u00a0physiologist to help patients get to a\u00a0healthy weight. It is not just a clinicalcentered\u00a0approach \u2014 it\u2019s a total\u00a0community health approach.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>HOW THE IPU WORKS:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>A patient\u2019s initial visit with the diabetes\u00a0team begins with a fasting blood draw\u00a0to determine blood glucose, HbA1c,\u00a0cholesterol, and other relevant lab values.\u00a0Following the blood draw, patients are\u00a0provided a diabetes-appropriate breakfast.\u00a0Next, the patient is asked to participate\u00a0in a small group discussion about issues\u00a0they have in dealing with diabetes,\u00a0led by a diabetes educator and nurse.\u00a0Facilitators are continually surprised at the\u00a0level of engagement in these groups \u2014\u00a0patients tend to share readily and openly.<\/p>\n<p>The group discussion not only introduces\u00a0patients to others who share similar\u00a0health and lifestyle challenges\u2014including\u00a0being overweight or obese and struggling\u00a0to engage in physical activity and eat\u00a0healthy\u2014but also enables the nurse\u00a0facilitator to determine the best match for\u00a0the patient with individual caregivers. After\u00a0the discussion, the entire group receives\u00a0an introduction to exercise with an exercise\u00a0physiologist who provides an easy, low\u00a0stress overview of exercise options.<\/p>\n<p>In the course of this first morning, the\u00a0patient sees the primary physician,\u00a0psychologist, diabetes educator, and\u00a0registered dietitian. Each patient also\u00a0receives a retinal scan and foot exam.\u00a0Finally, patients are served a diabetes friendly\u00a0lunch with the clinical team present\u00a0to answer questions about the food or\u00a0anything else related to diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>However, our work doesn\u2019t stop when\u00a0the patient leaves the clinic. Because\u00a0the needs of patients with type 2\u00a0diabetes require support and resources\u00a0in the community, our diabetes program\u00a0provides worksite and home services.\u00a0After their visit, a team member meets\u00a0with patients in their home to assess the\u00a0support network available and to identify\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">areas where patients will face particular\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">challenges. Our teams then work with\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">family and employers to inform and\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">facilitate improvements in the home and\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">work environments and sometimes in the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">local grocery stores and pharmacies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Often, the care team conducts a thorough\u00a0workplace assessment to determine how\u00a0each patient\u2019s work setting impacts his\u00a0or her health. For example, if there is no\u00a0access to healthy foods, we work with\u00a0the employer to improve the food options\u00a0at a worksite. It might be surprising\u00a0that employers have been incredibly\u00a0supportive, however they fully understand\u00a0the importance of having a healthy, happy,\u00a0and productive workforce.<\/p>\n<p>From the patient perspective, the most\u00a0important measure is improvement in the\u00a0ability to live (i.e., to work, participate in\u00a0family life, attend important events, and\u00a0enjoy daily activities). With each patient,\u00a0the care team identifies capabilities that\u00a0are motivating and meaningful and track\u00a0their improvement. While these measures\u00a0require greater effort to quantify, they are\u00a0often the drivers of people\u2019s long-term\u00a0commitment to lifestyle change and health.<\/p>\n<p>Patients have responded incredibly well. A\u00a0recent patient entered the program hoping\u00a0to improve his health, get off regular\u00a0insulin and lose about 60 lbs. With the\u00a0diabetes team\u2019s help, he understood the\u00a0need to deny barriers and stressors, such\u00a0as fast food and sugary drinks, and was\u00a0very successful.<\/p>\n<p>Through the program, he increased\u00a0glucose monitoring from to three to four\u00a0times daily; went from not exercising at\u00a0all to exercising four times a week at the\u00a0facility we recommended to him; attended\u00a0all prescribed education opportunities and\u00a0shared medical group appointments; and\u00a0engaged often with our dietician. While\u00a0he hasn\u2019t yet reached all his top-level\u00a0goals, he lost more than 45 lbs., reduced\u00a0his BMI from 33.7 to 27.5 and his waist\u00a0size from 44 to 36, and no longer needs\u00a0mealtime insulin coverage.<\/p>\n<p>The most successful patients are the\u00a0ones who receive a continuum of care\u00a0from the clinic to their community. Our\u00a0model improves a physician\u2019s capability\u00a0by bringing all of the necessary community\u00a0resources together. Research shows that\u00a0what happens outside the doctor\u2019s office\u00a0can have a major impact\u2014either positive\u00a0or negative\u2014on our health. That\u2019s why\u00a0we began the Diabetes IPU model and\u00a0why we\u2019ll continue using it to fight obesity\u00a0and improve the care of individuals with\u00a0prediabetes or diabetes.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/connecting-diabetes-care-from-the-clinic-to-the-community","date":"2014-09-04T08:06:44","modified":"2015-06-02T18:08:10","format":"standard","slug":"connecting-diabetes-care-from-the-clinic-to-the-community","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=8312","excerpt":"<p>BY JOHNNA REED, vice president,\u00a0business development, Bon Secours\u00a0Health System Access a PDF of the story with graphics and photos here.

However, as obesity rates began their steady climb upward over the last decade or so, local leaders and residents began to understand more fully the risks obesity can pose to their neighborhoods, communities and cities, and the role good government policy and action can have in helping people get and stay healthy.<\/p>\n<p>As this shift in public consciousness grew, mayors in cities across the country began to champion public policies that promote healthy eating and active living. These policies are meant to create more walkable, bikeable and transit-accessible neighborhoods, and to encourage better use of and increased connectivity between recreation centers and parks. They have commonly been implemented through shared-use agreements, land use agreements, community gardening initiatives and complete streets and active transportation policies. The most effective policies have been put in place by local leaders that were able to tap into specific community resources.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, mayors have an important role to play in forming partnerships and using their influence to put policies aimed at reducing obesity in motion. They are uniquely positioned to encourage citywide implementation of policies and programs that promote healthy communities.<\/p>\n<p>Today, policies to increase healthy eating and active living are being implemented all across the country. For instance, in Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter has led a number of policies that have revamped how the city approaches public health through food financing. The mayor, his staff and partners have forged public-private partnerships and provided incentives resulting in almost 20 retail sites offering fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Elsewhere in Pennsylvania and across the country, we\u2019ve seen the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trfund.com\/pennsylvania-fresh-food-financing-initiative\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fresh Food Financing Initiative<\/a> become a major model for assisting lower income people gain access to fresh, affordable food.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve also seen shared-use agreements welcomed wholeheartedly in communities throughout the South. In larger southern cities, complete streets policies have been incredibly important, while in both large and smaller communities mayors have worked to maximize community gardens and farmers markets. In particular, mayors have embraced policies that require farmers markets to accept Women, Infants and Children and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in Mississippi, communities have particularly embraced land use protection for community gardens. And Jackson, Miss. is one of a few cities to really look at how their city is oriented and figure out ways to improve walking and biking.<\/p>\n<p>There is similar work going on in Hernando and Tupelo, Miss., Charleston, S.C., Little Rock, Ark., and Baton Rouge, La. Some of these cities don\u2019t get mentioned as often as they should, but they are definitely leading the way in making policy changes that result in healthier communities.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, while the creation and support for these polices are great wins in the battle against obesity, it\u2019s unclear whether they are actually reaching and benefiting those in the most vulnerable neighborhoods. Complete streets policies, for example, have helped cities redesign their downtown, but often left other neighborhoods \u2014 where more economically disadvantaged people reside \u2013 largely untouched.<\/p>\n<p>The next step in the fight against obesity is moving from action to evaluating impact, i.e., making sure that health-promoting policies reach the communities that need them the most. There is far more to be done in this arena \u2013 mayors want to know how to target policies to ensure they are reaching their most vulnerable citizens.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we aren\u2019t there yet, but the conversations are happening and the wheels are starting to turn faster. And there is reason for optimism.<\/p>\n<p>One notable example is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.healthycommunitieshealthyfuture.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Let\u2019s Move!<\/em> Cities, Towns and Counties<\/a> (LMCTC), which is focused on several important areas connected to health disparities, including: training early childcare and education providers to promote physical activity and healthy eating; providing healthy foods to school-aged children before, during and after school and\/or during the summer; increasing access to healthy foods where cities offer and sell food; and ensuring appropriate city lands are optimized for play.<\/p>\n<p>So far, 425 local elected officials are engaged in LMCTC and moving forward important policy work focused on children and vulnerable populations. Also, there is a strong southern presence \u2013 Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and other states, which is particularly important given that region\u2019s high obesity rates and poverty levels. These are exactly the places we need to reach to truly stem the tide of obesity.<\/p>\n<p>LMCTC is just one opportunity for mayors to maximize their leadership and use their voice in addressing the health of their community, and, in particular, the health of vulnerable populations. When we talk about moving the needle, this is the logical progression.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/the-next-step-in-reducing-obesity-in-cities-towns-and-counties-focusing-on-vulnerable-populations","date":"2014-09-04T08:00:08","modified":"2015-06-02T17:51:53","format":"standard","slug":"the-next-step-in-reducing-obesity-in-cities-towns-and-counties-focusing-on-vulnerable-populations","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=8317","excerpt":"<p>BY LEON T.

Daniel Zoughbie, founder, chief executive officer &amp; president, Microclinic International<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need a recitation of statistics to know that chronic, preventable conditions \u2013 including obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke \u2013 are killing millions, creating poor quality of life for many others and causing exorbitant healthcare costs.<\/p>\n<p>I know firsthand how chronic conditions can change your life. Years ago, my grandmother passed away from diabetes complications in Palestine. The public health system was incapable of helping her. And, quite simply, most traditional efforts to stop the spread or reverse the epidemic of chronic diseases haven\u2019t worked, especially in areas where medical care is scarce.<\/p>\n<p>While improvements are necessary in healthcare delivery, quality and access, I began to consider the existing social and behavioral assets in communities that could better support chronic disease management. I was struck by the idea that behaviors \u2013 like smoking, overeating and sedentary lifestyles \u2013 can spread through someone\u2019s social interactions. I wondered if the reverse was also true: could social networks support and propagate positive behaviors \u2013 eating healthier, exercising, quitting smoking, etc.?<\/p>\n<p>With that background, Microclinic International (MCI) was founded to broaden the traditional scope of the global public health infrastructure, which tends to focus on the biological aspects of diseases, rather than the sociological factors.<\/p>\n<p>Our model brings together groups of two or more in a \u201cmicroclinic.\u201d A microclinic is not a building, but rather a real-life social group formed by the participant\u2019s family, friends, colleagues and\/or peers.\u00a0 Each group first meets in a central location where they receive education and engage in collective activities to promote healthy lifestyles.\u00a0 Then, they take what they have learned back to their homes, businesses and social networks.<\/p>\n<p>Our work relies on refocusing or optimizing what is already in a community. Microclinic programs do not require major investments in technology, infrastructure, or human resources. To fund and sustain a successful microclinic program requires participant recruitment, education, health screenings, and group support.<\/p>\n<p>When MCI joins with a community, we identify community partners and assess needs, including health status, economic factors, the social and physical environment, and existing community assets. Then, MCI trains local facilitators in the microclinic method and provides guidance as the program progresses. When participants gather for sessions, they learn from local practitioners, educators and experts who know and understand the community and its needs and customs.<\/p>\n<p>Our simple model has already been successful on three continents. Domestically, in 2011 Humana recruited and provided funding for MCI to bring our approach to Bell County, located in Appalachia in southeastern Kentucky.<\/p>\n<p>With sponsorship from Humana, MCI and the Bell County Health Department launched <em>Team Up 4 Health<\/em>. Over two years, more than 500 residents in Bell County joined together in roughly 170 microclinic groups, making small, simple changes to improve their overall health and better manage or prevent major chronic conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Weekly health education classes focused on making the healthy choice easier by having participants learn about healthy eating, sample unfamiliar healthy foods, and make regular exercise a habit. Local facilitators took participants to the grocery store to teach how to read food labels and make healthy affordable food choices. Participants took cooking classes together, shared healthy recipes, and audited their team members\u2019 refrigerators, looking for opportunities to swap out unhealthy foods.<\/p>\n<p>The program was a resounding success: Participants\u00a0lost an average of 6.52 pounds. At 16 months, participants had maintained an average decrease of 4.70 pounds, relative to the control group, which received only regular monitoring procedures for the purpose of data collection.<\/p>\n<p>And, a peer-reviewed randomized controlled trial published by the American Heart Association\u2019s Journal, <em>Circulation<\/em><em>, <\/em>found our model demonstrates \u201cpromise for the power of social networks to propagate healthy lifestyle behaviors for public health.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We weren\u2019t surprised that people got healthy. However, we were surprised that the entire county seemed to join in to make the healthy choice the easy choice. Three local parks now have fitness equipment, and the county has a new five-acre community garden where residents grow organic produce. Also, local schools have designed and implemented programs of their own to promote nutrition and physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>On a personal level, Willene Black has now made walking a regular habit since going through the program with her brother. She now reads food labels carefully, eats more fruits and vegetables and less fried food, and avoids high-calorie treats and soda. She\u2019s shared her new habits with her granddaughter as well, who has gone on to reduce her intake of sugary beverages.<\/p>\n<p>Another participant successfully fought high blood sugar levels and obesity by learning portion control and continuing a walking program.\u00a0 Her success didn\u2019t stop with her but extended to her neighbor, who was actually not even technically a part of her \u201cmicroclinic.\u201d The participant encouraged her neighbor to be her walking partner, and her friend lost more than 50 pounds.<\/p>\n<p>At MCI, we are not simply concerned with impact.\u00a0 We are also concerned about how to help more people. So, with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we trained 30 new microclinic program facilitators across eight counties of southeastern Kentucky, who will bring the program to hundreds of residents with or at-risk for chronic disease this year alone. And, we continue to work with partners across the health spectrum \u2013 from health insurance companies, to federal agencies like the CDC, local public health institutions, and motivated community members like those in southeastern Kentucky \u2013 to scale-up the program, making good health contagious in every city, state and country around the world.<\/p>\n<p>The microclinic program has proven effective across the world and in many different institutional settings.

and City of Decatur wanted to intentionally improve access to physical activity among families and children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to reach this population and fight childhood obesity is with a Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Program, which empowers communities to make walking and bicycling to school a safe and routine activity.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, two Decatur schools (Clairemont Elementary and Glennwood Academy) were part of a SRTS pilot program.<\/p>\n<p>Clairemont is located on a small residential street near downtown and has 265 kindergarten through third graders, most of whom live within 1.5 miles of the school. At the beginning of the project, approximately 13 percent of families walked or biked to school with some regularity.<\/p>\n<p>Glennwoood Academy is located just east of downtown Decatur and, at the time, had a population of approximately 300 fourth and fifth graders (now the school is kindergarten through third). However, this school drew from across the four square miles of City of Decatur, and our initial assessment indicated that around 7 percent walk or biked to school regularly.<\/p>\n<p>To begin, we created The Safe Routes to School Team and Infrastructure and Enforcement Task Force. The team was comprised of the principal, a teacher, and a parent from each school, as well as the project champion, Site Coordinator and project director. A student also attended School Team meetings as time permitted.<\/p>\n<p>The Task Force brought together the knowledge, expertise and experience of the community to address the engineering and enforcement aspects of the program and was composed of: two representatives from the City engineering staff; the City planner; a representative of the Police Department; a city commissioner; the principals; the school system transportation coordinator; a representative from the school superintendent\u2019s office; a parent representative from each school; the Project engineer; the Project Director; and the Project Site Coordinator.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to getting feedback from the team, the Task Force conducted several \u201cWalk-Abouts,\u201d to assess \u201cwalk-ability\u201d and \u201cbike-ability.\u201d Then, the Task Force developed a plan that would improve conditions for walking and biking.<\/p>\n<p>The Plan identified initial \u201cHot Spots\u201d for project attention, with the main focus on the areas in the vicinity of Clairemont and Glennwood schools. But, since Glennwood drew from the entire city, the Task Force also evaluated key crossings of the railroad track that separates the north and south sides of Decatur.<\/p>\n<p>Quickly, the relevant city departments went to work installing crosswalks, curb cuts and signs. In addition, some funds were used to purchase bike racks for each school and a local bike shop donated an additional rack.<\/p>\n<p>That said, completely revamping a portion of the city to make biking and walking for children safer and easier wasn\u2019t without its pitfalls. One particularly sticky crossroad was at a major intersection (College and Commerce) that didn\u2019t have a crossing guard.<\/p>\n<p>According to the police representative, no crossing guard had been assigned because of an observed lack of pedestrian use. Meanwhile, parents didn\u2019t use the crossing because they thought it was unsafe since there wasn\u2019t a crossing guard.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly broke the \u201cchicken and egg\u201d cycle by encouraging adults to supervise groups of children walking to school on that route. From this, the Winnona Park Walking Bus was created, with 30 to 40 children and adults crossing College and Commerce daily.<\/p>\n<p>After the infrastructure plans and safety concerns were addressed, it was time to get the children excited. In the spring, all 5th graders at Glennwood Elementary and all 3rd graders at Clairemont Elementary were trained in the &#8220;Safe Bike Drivers&#8221; course. The students practiced skills and learned \u201crules of the road.\u201d Then, they were given an opportunity to demonstrate their skills and, at the end, were given &#8220;Safe Bike Drivers Licenses&#8221; and the Governor&#8217;s Office of Highway Safety &#8220;Safe Bike Driver&#8221; activity book. To encourage parental reinforcement and practice, a flyer was sent home. Because of the success of these classes, the \u201cSafe Bike Drivers\u201d course was presented to all fourth and fifth graders through PE in the spring of 2006.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile 1st and 2nd graders participated in a 1.5 hour mini bicycle safety class focused on helmet fit, stopping at the end of a driveway, and dismounting to cross a street when riding on a sidewalk.<\/p>\n<p>When we formally launched the program the following fall, there was great involvement. We held an International Walk and Roll to School Day, using the same Walking Bus and Bike Train routes and general procedures. At Glennwood, 61 percent of the school population participated and, at Clairemont, 55 percent participated\u2014this despite rainy weather.<\/p>\n<p>It was so clear the program was a resounding success that it didn\u2019t take long to spread throughout the community to other schools.<\/p>\n<p>We followed the same model at every school that adopts a SRTS program: by basing the plan in community involvement and stakeholders. We\u2019ve seen amazing amounts of parental involvement in all facets of the program, from walking with kids to planning their own special routes. Our teams organize monthly walks and rolls to school and daily parent-led walking school buses and bike trains.<\/p>\n<p>When one parent noticed that less advantaged children were still being bused to school. She organized volunteers to go over Wednesday mornings to the housing development to meet those kids and have them all walk together. When it\u2019s cold, they bring extra mittens and gloves.<\/p>\n<p>Our citywide Safe Routes to School Program would never have been this successful without partners and community support\/resources. In addition to city planners, commissioners and engineers, the police played a vital role. Our police department continues to be incredibly supportive of the project and, on our first Walk and Roll to School Day, officers were present on foot, bike and patrol car.<\/p>\n<p>At the end, though, it\u2019s about the children and they are so happy to be active in getting to school. It\u2019s just the culture here that people want to walk\/bike. Kids have a group, they meet up and then they come to school.<\/p>\n<p>Safe Routes to School has brought together our entire community to work toward a common goal. One parent said, \u201cWe were lucky to be part of the program. The project was one that pulled the entire community together in a fun, learning process.\u201d Said another, \u201cWonderful program. Hope the City or school system can sustain it indefinitely.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There continues to be genuine pride in the steps we are taking to make it easier for our children to be safe and healthy\u2014partly because we got the entire community and all facets of the government involved.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/DSC086172.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7797\" title=\"DSC08617\" src=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/DSC086172-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/walking-rolling-a-community-comes-together-to-make-it-safer-and-healthier-for-children-to-get-to-school","date":"2014-05-16T05:03:08","modified":"2015-06-02T18:00:37","format":"standard","slug":"walking-rolling-a-community-comes-together-to-make-it-safer-and-healthier-for-children-to-get-to-school","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=7786","excerpt":"<p>By Cheryl Burnette, assistant director, Active Living Division, City of Decatur, Georgia Nearly a decade ago, the state of Georgia and City of Decatur wanted to intentionally improve access to physical activity among families and children.

Dr. Bechara Choucair,\u00a0Commissioner, Chicago Department of Public Health<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From clean water supplies to the polio vaccine, the most effective public health interventions are typically preventative interventions and policies that help stop a crisis before it starts. But predicting the next public health crisis has historically been a challenge, and even interventions like distilling water or distributing a vaccine are in many ways reactive, following an initial outbreak of some kind. Thanks to new technologies, we are piloting a new way to predict where and what that initial outbreak will be, so we can intervene and stop it before it ever begins.<\/p>\n<p>Predictive analytics is a new approach that employs an array of public health data to predict who is most susceptible to birth complications or chronic diseases or where and when a virulent outbreak is most likely to occur. With this information, public health officials should be able to respond before the issue manifests itself \u2013 providing the right prenatal treatments to mitigate birth complications, providing diet recommendations to overcome a chronic disease or distributing vaccines early to ensure an outbreak is contained. Similar to how a flu shot can reduce your chances of getting the flu \u2013 especially among those most vulnerable to the disease \u2013 predictive analytics should be able to reduce the chances of other health issues from ever starting.<\/p>\n<p>This would transform how government operates, how resources are allocated and greatly benefit the public\u2019s health.<\/p>\n<p>But predictive analytics aren\u2019t the future \u2013 they are already here. While the greatest benefits have yet to be realized, at the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) we are already leveraging data and history to make smarter, more targeted decisions today by piloting predictive analytics within our food safety program.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, CDPH partnered with development and coding groups to identify various data related to food establishments and their locations &#8211; building environments and building code violations, sourcing of food, registered complaints, lighting in the alley behind the food establishment, near-by construction, social media reports, sanitation code violations, neighborhood population density, complaint histories of other establishments with the same owner and more.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next month, our food inspectors will use these data to determine establishments most at risk for health code violations, evaluating several hundred establishments to test the model. Based on their results and additional stakeholder input, we will evaluate the system and make adjustments as needed. Once it is proven successful, we will expand the program to help identify more health code violations more quickly, helping to make our food supply even safer and prevent more cases of food poisoning before they occur.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, this new system will not replace our current program. We will still inspect every food establishment following our current schedule, ensuring the entire food supply remains safe and healthy for our residents and tourists. But predictive analytics will allow us to better concentrate our efforts on those establishments more likely to have challenges. In time, this system will help us work more closely with restaurateurs so they can improve their business and decrease complaints. In short, businesses and their customers will both be happier and healthier.<\/p>\n<p>This new model builds on earlier innovations CDPH has made concerning food protection. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported, most cases of foodborne illnesses go unreported as health agencies typically wait for customers to file an official report. To fix this discrepancy, CDPH and its partners launched a new application on Twitter, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodbornechicago.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.foodbornechicago.org<\/a>, where the agency monitors public tweets from Chicago that mention food poisoning.\u00a0\u00a0 Whenever a resident tweets about a case of food poisoning in the City, CDPH responds and invites the individual to provide additional information so our inspectors can follow up. And it\u2019s working.<\/p>\n<p>Since its launch in March 23, 2013, 191 cases have been reported through the new system, resulting in spot inspections that would not have occurred otherwise. Not only have these inspections yielded additional health code violations, in one case, an outbreak, affecting numerous individuals, was identified sooner by CDPH thanks to early reports via Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The Twitter application has already proven successful, allowing CDPH to identify previously unreported problems. We fully expect the predictive analytics pilot will prove to be equally successful, further improving the department\u2019s inspections and the health and safety of the food supply.

Instead, Lancaster County is served by a regional health department that is responsible for the entire southeast portion of Pennsylvania. So, for some time, our community\u2019s health has been a shared responsibility by a broad health collaborative with, often, Lancaster General Health, the local nonprofit hospital, at the center of initiatives and programs.<\/p>\n<p>In the mid-90s, this loose collaborative decided to conduct our first county-wide health needs assessment. After the assessment, it was decided that Lancaster General Health would take on the responsibility of periodically conducting assessments and we have done so ever since.<\/p>\n<p>For many reasons, this evolving community approach to health dramatically informed the way our hospital did business. Through the leadership of our President\/CEO and Board of Trustees (BOT), community health improvement was elevated to a Board level committee.\u00a0 \u00a0In fact, the chairperson of our community benefit* committee becomes the chair of the hospital\u2019s entire board the following year. Our succession bylaws require our board chair to fully understand and be well versed in the importance of expanding our reach from the clinical setting into the community. Over the past 20 years, Lancaster General, the various BOTs, and each committee operated with the idea that good public health doesn\u2019t happen solely in the clinical setting.<\/p>\n<p>Another advantage to starting from health needs assessments is that we learned quickly how good data can help inform decisions. For instance, in 2000, our health needs assessment demonstrated that tobacco, in the form of cardiovascular disease, was taking a huge toll on our community. We also were aware that the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement was about to start dispersing funds to localities.<\/p>\n<p>With data from the assessment and support from the Master Settlement, we were able to create a community coalition \u2013 which included all four county hospitals, the county\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Commission, district schools, local colleges and others \u2013 to implement best practices on preventing tobacco use, including ensuring people have access to tobacco dependence treatment and training healthcare providers to ask about tobacco use, advise cessation and refer patients to resources. In addition, we educated worksites and policy leaders on how to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and created youth-based programs so tobacco use is not seen as the norm for our community.\u00a0 \u00a0As a result, our county went from 23 percent tobacco usage to 13 percent among adults.<\/p>\n<p>As we continued to conduct assessments, it became clear that obesity was surpassing tobacco as the county\u2019s biggest health threat. Learning from our work on tobacco, Lancaster General Health, serving as a sort of integrator, began another community coalition called Lighten Up Lancaster. After about a year or so of work, we became aware of Community Transformation Grants (CTG), which focus on increasing clinical preventative services, healthy eating, healthy and safe physical environments, active living and tobacco free living.<\/p>\n<p>Initial and pilot projects of Lighten Up Lancaster have included creating extensive awareness resources, managing the process of changing a city ordinance to allow mobile fresh food vendors to operate in residential neighborhoods, coordinating a training session for school wellness council coordinators from the 16 local school districts and developing a\u00a0scorecard to track the level of obesity prevention awareness \u201cimpressions\u201d. The scorecard project is of particular importance because, with obesity increasing at epidemic proportions, it is critical that our community understands the enormity of the problem. Heightened awareness of the health issue works to increase the number of adults and children maintaining a healthy weight.<\/p>\n<p>In short, Lighten Up Lancaster promotes policy, system and environmental changes that will reduce obesity by focusing on complete streets, bikeability\/walkability, increasing access to healthy foods and improving school district nutrition policies.<\/p>\n<p>All of Lighten Up Lancaster\u2019s members are committed to a concentrated, organized effort to fight obesity. Without their work, there would be only fragmented programs, probably focused on individual workplaces or schools. In reality, a broad-based approach is required to tackle this long term challenge through policy, systems and environmental changes focused on improving nutrition and increasing physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>We have been successful in Lancaster for many reasons. We have great community organizations that come together when a problem has been identified. Lancaster General Health serves in the data collection and dissemination role in addition to community convener. Figure 1 highlights the establishment of collaboratives that focus on specific health issues. In addition to the Harm Reduction Coalition, some examples of \u201cissue specific\u201d coalitions are Lighten Up Lancaster Coalition, Tobacco-Free Coalition of Lancaster County, Mental Health Collaborative and Refugee Health Network to name a few.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/yoder-photo.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-7287\" title=\"yoder photo\" src=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/yoder-photo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"557\" height=\"403\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With the advent of population health management and accountable care organizations, there has been increased emphasis on the work Lancaster community has been doing for some time. In short, it\u2019s painfully clear that if you\u2019re working to improve the health of a community you must include all the relevant partners, which boils down to basically every community group from education to commerce to transportation to traditional public health. In addition, there needs to be an organization that oversees all community resources and organizations, and, with data, can help create a plan to address the most pressing health needs of a community.<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p><em>* <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More on \u201cCommunity Benefit\u201d<\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIn order for a nonprofit hospital to be exempt from federal income tax, they are required to provide community benefit.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMsa073350\" target=\"_blank\">remaining 60 percent<\/a> reflect our behaviors, our social circumstances, and our environmental exposures.<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s this 60 percent that we can improve through public health. And the Affordable Care Act (ACA) recognizes and supports such an approach\u2014here in Philadelphia and across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Through the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the ACA sets aside federal resources so that state and local agencies\u2014public, private, and non-profit\u2014can promote healthy behaviors and environments. In other words, these initiatives aim to make the healthy choice, the easy choice for Americans. Such efforts lead to better health and lower health care costs in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, too many people live, work, or go to school in communities that make unhealthy choices the default. In Philadelphia, cigarettes are commonly available for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phila.gov\/health\/pdfs\/Tobacco%20and%20sugary%20drinks%20ad%20report_82013_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">under $5 per pack<\/a>, making a half-pack per day habit cheaper than over-the-counter nicotine patches. Children can buy <a href=\"http:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/124\/5\/1293.full?hits=10&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;FULLTEXT=corner+store&amp;SEARCHID=1&amp;gca=pediatrics%253B124%252F5%252F1293&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">350 calories of chips, soda, and candy<\/a> for just over $1 at local corner stores. And popular lunch items at Chinese take-out restaurants in low-income neighborhoods have more than a day\u2019s worth of sodium.<\/p>\n<p>The City\u2019s <strong><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodfitphilly.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Healthy Philly<\/a><\/em><\/strong> initiative\u2014with funding through the ACA and other public and private sources\u2014has tackled these challenges head-on. In fact, Get Healthy Philly takes on the issues that doctors, patients, and insurers can\u2019t address on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Medicaid provides publicly-funded insurance coverage for over 70,000 low-income smokers in Philadelphia. However, local Medicaid plans were not providing comprehensive coverage for smoking cessation aids, like nicotine patches and gum. When smokers are offered such coverage, they are more likely to make a successful quit attempt. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029665\" target=\"_blank\">That\u2019s good for smokers and good for those paying their medical bills<\/a>. Get Healthy Philly partnered with Medicaid plans in the city to expand pharmaceutical coverage for smoking cessation in 2010. Since then, there has been a 10 percent to 20 percent increase in utilization of nicotine replacement therapy and a 10 percent decline in smoking rates among Philadelphians covered by Medicaid.<\/p>\n<p>Get Healthy Philly is building on this success by encouraging large employers in the region to remove or reduce copayments for medications used to treat smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Through such <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sph.umich.edu\/vbidcenter\/registry\/pdfs\/2009-0119_EvidenceThatValue-BasedInsurance%20CanBeEffective.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">value-based insurance changes<\/a>, employees can achieve improved adherence to chronic disease therapies and better health, while employers can lower overall health care costs. The ACA is enacting complementary strategies by removing cost-sharing for high-value preventive services, such as immunizations and cancer screening.<\/p>\n<p>Small businesses have also been a key partner in creating a healthier Philadelphia. Now, 650 corner stores and bodegas are part of our <a href=\"http:\/\/foodfitphilly.org\/eat-healthy\/healthy-corner-stores\/\" target=\"_blank\">Healthy Corner Store Network<\/a>, led by The Food Trust. Store owners commit to adding at least four new healthy products to their inventory, receive business training, and promote healthy items in their stores. Nearly 300 stores received small shelving and refrigeration units to store and display perishables. As a result, the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat milk has increased, and store owners report solid sales and strengthened relationships with their communities. Over the last two years, 60,000 Philadelphians in low-income neighborhoods have seen increased access to healthy foods.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, over 220 Chinese take-out restaurants in the city have committed to reducing sodium in the 3.2 million meals they serve annually. Get Health Philly partnered with the Temple University Center for Asian Health, the Chinese Restaurant Association, and the Asian Community Health Coalition to implement the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/08\/23\/philadelphia-salt-chinese-takeout-hypertension-blood-pressure_n_3804107.html\" target=\"_blank\">Healthy Chinese Take-out Initiative<\/a>. Restaurant owners and chefs received education about the links between excess sodium consumption and hypertension, training in low-sodium cooking techniques, and information on low-sodium ingredients. Six months after this intervention, sodium content dropped by 20 percent in two popular meals\u2014shrimp &amp; broccoli and chicken lo mein. These community-based efforts will support doctors and patients in managing diseases like hypertension, which affects nearly 40 percent of adults in Philadelphia.<\/p>\n<p>Along with effective, scalable programs, public health policy plays a critical role in improving the health of populations. The ACA included federal menu labeling legislation, requiring all chain restaurants in the U.S. to post calorie information on menus and menu boards. Unfortunately, the FDA has yet to issue regulations guiding implementation of the law. Philadelphia is one of several communities that passed and implemented local menu labeling laws prior to the ACA. Moreover, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2011-P-0646-0001\" target=\"_blank\">Philadelphia\u2019s law is the strongest in the country<\/a>, mandating not just calories but also sodium, saturated fat, and carbohydrate labeling on menus of sit-down chain restaurants. Soon after implementation in 2010, most chain restaurants in the city were in compliance. And, a recent evaluation suggests that customers in Philadelphia restaurants purchased lower calorie, lower sodium meals than customers outside of the city in unlabeled establishments. Through Get Healthy Philly, Philadelphia is pursuing other effective public health policies, such as smoke-free parks, universities, and multi-unit housing; nutrition standards for all City-funded food procurement contracts; and content-neutral retail advertising restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>With support from the ACA, Philadelphia and other communities are demonstrating that public health can address gaps in medical care by creating healthier home, school, workplace, and neighborhood environments. These efforts will prove even more important as millions of Americans become insured over the next several years. The goal is to keep people healthy rather than treating them only when they are sick.

Nancy Garrett, Ph.D., Chief Analytics Officer, Hennepin County Medical Center<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When Minnesota decided to expand Medicaid to a poor, childless adult population in Hennepin County, the interested parties decided to take an innovative approach to ensure patients were receiving the kind of care they needed to be healthy. In essence, we built a Social Accountable Care Organization (ACO), a model wherein a group of healthcare partners (Hennepin Health) took on more risk and partnered with social services to care for this vulnerable population.<\/p>\n<p>Hennepin Health was formed as a capitated Medicaid demonstration project by four organizations: Hennepin County Medical Center, NorthPoint Health and Wellness (a Federally Qualified Health Center), Metropolitan Health Plan and the county\u2019s Human Services and Public Health Department (including Health Care for the Homeless, the county\u2019s Mental Health Center and other social services). The providers bill the plan on a fee for service basis and split the gain (or loss) at the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Together, we serve over 6,000 enrollees who face some stark health realities: 45 percent have chemical dependencies, 42 percent have mental health needs, 32 percent have unstable housing and 30 percent suffer from at least two chronic diseases. In total, the top 5 percent of the population\u2019s healthcare utilizers demand 64 percent of the available healthcare dollars.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, the old system wasn\u2019t working for these individuals. So, we built our model on the concepts of a primary care medical home with a strong continuum of care coordination paired with addressing the social determinants of health (housing, substance abuse, joblessness, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>For this population, before you can even address the traditional health problems of a patient, you have to look at the social and behavioral issues present, which makes the partnership with the county\u2019s social services so vital. For every patient, we try to meet them where they are and we\u2019ve found that when we can get someone to a stable housing situation they are then able to start working on the prevailing health issues. Quickly, we decided to move mental health specialists directly into the clinic to provide easy access to care for the patient and consultation for primary care providers.<\/p>\n<p>This approach has paid dividends to our bottom line and the health and wellbeing of all our patients. For one patient, who was a frequent utilizer of the emergency department, our model has improved his life dramatically. When we looked at his admission rates, we realized someone needed to coordinate the vast array of care he needed: he had many chronic conditions and the coordinator found the patient was also homeless.<\/p>\n<p>So, the care coordinator called her partner social worker and together they found stable healthy housing. In that process, the coordinator discovered that the patient was interested in getting a job. We realized this was not unique to this individual so we used some of our savings to bring an employment counselor to the clinic to help people with behavioral problems learn how to get and keep a job. The counselor works to place them at a job and helps the patient for a year afterward, so they can retain their job.<\/p>\n<p>Without the relationship with the care coordinator, we never would have had this patient applying for jobs and working on managing his chronic conditions. He has accessed primary care consistently and is much better health-wise. Even when this patient slipped and ended up in detox, his first call was to the care coordinator for help. This example demonstrates that there\u2019s no easy fix with socially complex patients. There will be ups and downs, but if relationships exist and you can connect people with the appropriate social services, patients\u2019 lives and health will improve. What could have been a complete substance abuse spiral ending in an emergency department visit became a simple call to a care coordinator who connected the patient with the appropriate services.<\/p>\n<p>For our model to work this seamlessly all of the partners have to buy in. It was relatively easy for us since every partner is governed by the county and we serve the same populations. While we weren\u2019t used to working with one another, through trial and error, we have found effective ways to collaborate.<\/p>\n<p>It also doesn\u2019t hurt that there are dollars at the table. If, collectively, we can treat the population for less, the money can be dispersed back to the partners and invested outside the conventional government boundaries into innovative ideas that better help those who we have spent our entire careers trying to help.\u00a0 We will finally focus on prevention.<\/p>\n<p>Our early results are positive. We have seen an increase in primary care visits and non-billable phone and email visits as well as reduced medication costs. There have been increased connections of patients to social services (food assistance, transportation and financial assistance) and substance abuse and mental health services.<\/p>\n<p>In our first year, Hennepin Health reduced emergency department visits by more than 20 percent. In fact, spending for some of the program\u2019s top 200 users of medical services dropped. In total, the county has been able to reinvest more than $1 million in savings toward filling service gaps and providing even better, cost-saving, care.<\/p>\n<p>We have used excess funds to pay for on-site behavioral health counselors and licensed alcohol and drug counselors, the employment counselor and expanding our complex care clinic. We plan on using future dollars to provide interim housing for people who are ready to leave the hospital but don\u2019t have a stable housing situation.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll also be building a sobering center. Looking at our data, a lot of the emergency department capacity has been used by people who are simply intoxicated. They didn\u2019t need medical care, they needed somewhere to sober up. So, instead of using these valuable resources, we\u2019ll build a separate center that can be minimally staffed and a lot less expensive than an emergency room visit.<\/p>\n<p>Another beneficial aspect of this diverse, but dependent group of partners was the ability to share data. While it was time consuming and difficult to plan out the technical and legal aspects, we\u2019ve built a data warehouse that includes claims from the plan, Epic information (one of the best, most integrated electronic health systems (EHR), and some social services data.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing in the social services data and combining it with medical history provides as full a picture as possible of a current individual\u2019s health and wellness. We have installed EHRs in a lot of social service agencies so they know what\u2019s going on with medical care and medical providers will know what kind of social services a patient needs when they are treating them.<\/p>\n<p>We can also use the warehouse as a sort of drug monitoring program. When we created the plan we really wanted to include dental. With the analytics, we can tell who is having a dental emergency versus who has been to the emergency room frequently for painkillers for various ailments. We can then track these individuals and get them into counseling.<\/p>\n<p>There is always more we can do. Right now, we\u2019re conducting a lifestyle survey to get information on health risk behaviors (smoking, exercise, access to healthy foods, etc.) to understand the determinants of health. We have only completed surveys of about 10 percent of our population, but, for those 10 percent, the data is coming into the warehouse and will be added to the record and accessed by social services and healthcare.<\/p>\n<p>A successful health system must meet an individual\u2019s basic needs before it can improve health. Experience has shown that social disparities often result in poor health management and costly revolving door care. Quite simply, by coordinating systems and services, Hennepin Health has improved health outcomes and reduced costs.<\/p>\n<p>Success requires innovation, collaboration with non-traditional healthcare, adaptive and decisive leadership to force major systems changes and lean processing to streamline systems and reduce waste. By intentionally linking social services with healthcare, Hennepin Health is saving money and improving the health of individuals who are traditionally among the most costly and difficult to treat.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on Hennepin Health, see:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hennepin.us\/healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">Hennepin Health: the County&#8217;s Health Care<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Hennepin-Health-TFAH-July-2013.ppt\" target=\"_blank\">Hennepin Health: People.

Carolyn Jenkins, DrPH, APRN-BC-ADM, RD, LD, FAAN, Professor and Ann Darlington Edwards Endowed Chair, Director, SCTR Community Engagement Core, Medical University of South Carolina<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nearly 20 years ago, the Medical University of South Carolina was charged by the state legislature to investigate diabetes and ascertain the related problems and challenges.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Not surprisingly, we found that diabetes cases were rising and disproportionately affecting underserved and minority populations. In addition, we quickly realized that the number of diabetes-related amputations far exceeded what we thought would be occurring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">The result of that initial work was a study focused on addressing the prevalence of diabetes by improving professional education of providers, fostering better community relations and increasing surveillance and data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">I inherited the community piece and it quickly became my lifelong work. A year or two after we started to address diabetes at the community level by creating a coalition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began collecting proposals for the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) grants. Suddenly, my work, which was largely without dedicated funding, had the opportunity to receive additional resources to specifically focus on reducing the disparities faced by Blacks at risk for or living with diabetes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">So, the University applied for the grant on behalf of the Diabetes Initiative of South Carolina, with a deep focus in Charleston and Georgetown Counties. Georgetown was actually a late addition to the proposal, as they didn\u2019t announce their intention until about 24 hours before the grant was due. However, in short order, we received 50 letters of support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">This was one of the first indications that there was great interest in addressing diabetes at the community level. In fact, when we started the work, community groups kept coming and saying diabetes was a huge problem in their community, but they didn\u2019t have the resources or expertise to design a successful grant to CDC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">For there to be good work, you have to have a good plan. Early on, I made the administrative decision that the University wasn\u2019t going to go into communities and say \u201clook at these statistics, they\u2019re just terrible.\u201d Instead, we asked the communities what challenges they faced in relation to diabetes and what they wanted to do about it and then identified what we could do together. I didn\u2019t want to start with the University as a driver of community-based solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">This approach didn\u2019t exactly allow us to hit the ground running. However, after several months of community members asking me what the University was going to do and my answer being \u201cwe\u2019re going to do whatever you think will solve the problem,\u201d they finally got the picture. It was as if the light bulb turned on and everyone realized this wasn\u2019t going to be the typical University grant exercise, wherein the University comes in, experiments with communities and disappears when the money goes away. It was important to show that the University was in this for the long haul and we were building a true academic-community partnership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>From then on, community organizations began providing ideas for how to address diabetes. And, what\u2019s even better, the issues they identified were the same as what the epidemiological data indicated \u2013 this was very empowering for the community.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Together, we looked at diabetes and all the negative health outcomes as well as the community assets to figure out what to focus on in the three to five years we had to document outcomes. Everyone, from local podiatrists to the traditional health system to the community, told us that people with diabetes had two great fears: losing their legs and having to go on \u201cthe kidney machine\u201d (dialysis). But, ultimately, they decided that their legs were most important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, amputations were a big problem at that time, as patients were showing up to hospitals and primary care providers with extensive sores and even gangrene. It appeared that a lot of the problems were in the health system and in the way the health system was dealing with the people in the community.<\/p>\n<p>At first, the healthcare providers were a bit resistant as they saw the problem as belonging to the patient who often \u201cdid not take care of their diabetes.\u201d However, I and the University helped the community recognize that providers and their patients needed support and weren\u2019t to blame.<\/p>\n<p>When we started saying \u201cthe problem belongs to all of us,\u201d the entire continuum of care could come together. For instance, a certified medical assistant can look at someone\u2019s feet and check whether someone is in danger of losing a leg. So, we taught anyone who would listen how to conduct foot exams. We even developed a foot care course for nurses.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, the community bonds were so tight that podiatrists made an agreement with community health workers that if a patient couldn\u2019t afford care and the community health worker called the podiatrist, they would see the patient for just a $5 co-pay and, if there was a lesion, they would see the person for free if the person had no money or insurance.<\/p>\n<p>We also built basic principles for working together as a coalition that involved listening to each other and the community, clearly putting health issues on the table and being open minded about the issue. Slowly, community, patient, doctor, nurse, and pharmacist learned to speak the same language.<\/p>\n<p>It was also important for community health workers to educate patients on how to communicate with providers by encouraging patients to ask doctors and nurses \u201cwhat the numbers mean.\u201d\u00a0 We responded to provider concerns about how they would get paid to provide the quality of diabetes care we were seeking, and worked with the state legislature to establish insurance coverage for diabetes education and supplies.\u00a0 We also responded to concerns about the multiple standards for diabetes care, and synthesized all the diabetes guidelines into a two-page document.\u00a0 We\u2019ve incorporated these guidelines into the health professions curriculum and continuing education programs.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, we\u2019ve made significant progress in improving the delivery of diabetes care, including lower A1Cs and blood pressure in people with diabetes and we\u2019ve narrowed the gap between the amputation rates for Blacks and whites in Georgetown and Charleston Counties. Community-wide, our statistics are looking better and we estimate that we save between $1.6 to $2 million a year in prevented amputations.<\/p>\n<p>With this academic-community-provider partnership forged, we began to look at health systems quality improvement teams around community health workers, which we call community health advocates. We trained and employed the advocates to help patients navigate the health system and coordinate a continuum of care.\u00a0 At the same time, the advocates trained us how to work more effectively with the community.<\/p>\n<p>The advocates went into the community and learned what was and wasn\u2019t happening to improve health. Initially, they found that men were not showing up for treatment. To address this, they created numerous community-based solutions.\u00a0 One example was an all-male play that was a take-off of <em>Steel Magnolias<\/em>. In essence, it was a womanless wedding, during which they served diabetes-appropriate food, one actor had to have an amputation and others acted out the dangers of not monitoring blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n<p>In short order, the advocates had built trust between the traditional health systems and patients, who had little to no interaction previously. To expand their work, before there were electronic health records, the partners worked together to build a diabetes registry to identify which patients had come into health centers and were in danger of developing diabetes or not controlling their condition. They helped patients navigate the center and traditional healthcare and offered education programs on how to control diabetes to patients, families, and friends in the community, at churches, beauty parlors and other community gathering places.\u00a0 In addition, they provided referrals to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to increase access to primary care and connected patients with social services to link them with the resources needed to manage diabetes and avoid amputations and hospitalizations.<\/p>\n<p>While this was happening, the traditional health system moved more and more into the community. As one health provider worked in the community, he became an advocate to his colleagues and, often, providers were \u201chooked\u201d on doing more community work than they had originally intended.<\/p>\n<p>In short, community ownership made all the difference. The University, instead of being a traditional academic institute at arm\u2019s length, served the necessary role of the catalyst for change. The University team being out there in the community was vital to success:\u00a0 every time we hit a snag, someone had to be positive and get the right community leaders to look at the problem and see what the community could do about it.<\/p>\n<p>For any health intervention to work, the emphasis needs to be on a broad based ownership of health. There is no one or two groups that can truly and fully benefit and improve a community\u2019s health. While there will be one or two groups that lead, they must bring in the entire community support structure, including nontraditional support from outside the health world (schools, sororities\/fraternities, churches, clubs, business, foundations, and others).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the Georgetown and Charleston County REACH Coalition, see:<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\" href=\"http:\/\/academicdepartments.musc.edu\/reach\/overview\/\" target=\"_blank\">REACH US SEA-CEED<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/South-Carolina-1-11-12.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">REACH Charleston and Georgetown Diabetes Coalition, South Carolina: Case Study of a Place-Based Approach<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/MUSC-REACH-Charleston-Georgetown-Diabetes-Coalition-Integrator-Final-10-9-12.doc\" target=\"_blank\">An Academic-Community Partnership: The Medical University of South Carolina College of Nursing and REACH Charleston and Georgetown Diabetes Coalition as Integrators<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nursingcenter.com\/lnc\/pdfjournal?AID=1109817&amp;an=00003727-201101001-00009&amp;Journal_ID=&amp;Issue_ID=\" target=\"_blank\">REACH Charleston and Georgetown Diabetes Coalition\u2019s Efforts to Decrease Diabetes-Related Amputations in African Americans<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3197706\/pdf\/nihms324311.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Medical Model:\u00a0 Interdisciplinary Programs of Community-based Health Research<\/a><\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/saving-a-leg-a-community-focused-on-improving-diabetes","date":"2013-11-12T03:41:10","modified":"2015-06-02T18:11:36","format":"standard","slug":"saving-a-leg-a-community-focused-on-improving-diabetes","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6930","excerpt":"<p>By, Carolyn Jenkins, DrPH, APRN-BC-ADM, RD, LD, FAAN, Professor and Ann Darlington Edwards Endowed Chair, Director, SCTR Community Engagement Core, Medical University of South Carolina &nbsp; Nearly 20 years ago, the Medical University of South Carolina was charged by the state legislature to investigate diabetes and ascertain the related problems and challenges.

by, Janine E. Janosky, Ph.D., Vice President, Head, Center for Community Health Improvement, Austen BioInnovation Institute in Akron<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2011, Austen BioInnovation Institute (ABIA)<a title=\"\" href=\"file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/ALang\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/Temporary%20Internet%20Files\/Content.Outlook\/N4J56D9Z\/Akron%20ACC%20Final%20Case%20Study.docx#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> in Akron, Ohio brought together a wide range of more than 70 different groups to launch the first-of-its-kind Accountable Care Community (ACC).<\/p>\n<p>The ACC is focused on improving the health of the community and incentivizing the health system to reward improved health while delivering cost effective care. Success is measured by factors such as the improved health of the whole community, cost effectiveness and cost savings in the healthcare system, improved patient experience for those using the healthcare system, job creation in Akron, and more.<\/p>\n<p>The effort began by zeroing in one of the most widespread, high cost preventable health problems in their community: type 2 diabetes. Approximately 11 percent of adults in Akron have diabetes, and 2.1 percent more are considered pre-diabetic and are at risk for developing full blown diabetes. People with diabetes have 2.3 times higher average medical costs per year than non-diabetics. If current trends continue, one-third of the Akron population could have diabetes by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>Of the individuals with type 2 diabetes involved in Akron\u2019s ACC, around 38 percent have private health insurance, 31 percent have public health insurance (Medicare or Medicaid) and 31 percent have no health insurance. Combined, around 80 percent of the county\u2019s population are represented.<\/p>\n<p>Effective approaches to prevent and control diabetes require a comprehensive approach of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. The ACC leverages the resources and expertise of a wide range of organizations, including the major health systems and healthcare providers, local public health district, employers, the Chamber of Commerce, universities, housing groups, public parks and city planners, transportation groups, economic developers and planners, a range of faith-based organizations and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Strong, consistent medical care that is affordable and\/or covered is vital to managing or preventing diabetes. In addition, daily self-management and maintaining a healthy diet and higher levels of physical activity are necessary to help those with diabetes improve their health and prevent others from developing diabetes in the first place. Some of the activities and initiatives promoted by the ACC, in addition to those directly related to education and care for disease, have included community gardens, fresh food preparation, exercise and others.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, the ACC has worked on the following initiatives: (1) expansion of the concept of \u201cpublic lands for public health\u201d with the Cuyahoga Valley National Park; (2) a regional health impact assessment of the Akron Marathon; (3) partnerships with the faith-based community and the University of Akron for health education and increasing screenings for individuals who are underserved including refugees, Native-Americans, the homeless, and those in low-income housing; and (4) work with the Akron Metropolitan Transportation System to transform some of the local roadways into \u201cComplete Streets\u201d<a title=\"\" href=\"file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/ALang\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/Temporary%20Internet%20Files\/Content.Outlook\/N4J56D9Z\/Akron%20ACC%20Final%20Case%20Study.docx#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the collaborative recognized that knowledge and information management is essential to understanding and analyzing health and cost patterns. This led the ACC to develop systems for confidential sharing of patient data using an integrated data platform, which allows healthcare entities to track health trends and cost savings. Participating hospitals and providers receive a share of the healthcare cost savings achieved by the program, and other funds are reinvested in the ACC or other community efforts.<\/p>\n<p>The initiative also received a Community Transformation Grant (CTG), which was created by the Affordable Care Act, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help support their activities. CTGs are awarded to communities that are taking integrated, evidence-based approaches to preventing disease.<\/p>\n<p>In just over two years, the initiative has already seen positive results:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average cost per month of care for individuals with diabetes was reduced by more than 10 percent per month;<\/li>\n<li>After one year of involvement, consistent reductions in healthcare costs are in excess of 25 percent with estimated program savings of $3,185 per person per year;<\/li>\n<li>Decline in emergency department visits because of diabetes: a drop from nine to six emergency room visits for people in the higher glycated hemoglobin ranges (HbA1c&gt;8%); and a drop from six to three visits for people in the lower glycated hemoglobin ranges (HbA1c&lt;8%);<\/li>\n<li>More than half of participants lost weight and reduced waist size;<\/li>\n<li>Lowered cost per person per contact hour with healthcare providers ($25 vs. $37.50 for other leading diabetes prevention programs);<\/li>\n<li>Better management leading to decrease in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) (a measure of diabetes) and LCL cholesterol (often known as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) levels;<\/li>\n<li>No amputations because of diabetes;<\/li>\n<li>Increase in reported exercise and flexibility;<\/li>\n<li>Significantly fewer days in which reported mental and physical health was not good;<\/li>\n<li>Improved self-rated health; and<\/li>\n<li>Improvement in knowledge surrounding healthier dietary choices, health behaviors and diabetes self-management.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The ACC has been successful in improving quality of care, lowering the cost of care, delaying the progression of disease, expanding the population receiving comprehensive care, reducing the overall burden of disease in the community, and increasing productivity. The initiative is planning to expand to focus on additional health problems, such as obesity, hypertension and asthma. Akron is a healthier place with lower healthcare costs because of the ACC, and it is more attractive to businesses and other groups because of its more vibrant and productive workforce.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the Akron Accountable Care Community, see:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.abiakron.org\/1accountable-care-community\" target=\"_blank\">Austen BioInnovation Institute in Akron<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.abiakron.org\/Data\/Sites\/1\/pdf\/accwhitepaper12012v5final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Healthier by Design: Creating Accountable Care Communities<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/transforming-health-by-developing-an-accountable-care-community\" target=\"_blank\">Transforming Health by Developing an Accountable Care Community<\/a><\/p>\n<div>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" \/>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/ALang\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/Temporary%20Internet%20Files\/Content.Outlook\/N4J56D9Z\/Akron%20ACC%20Final%20Case%20Study.docx#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> ABIA is a unique biomedical innovation institute, founded in 2008 by Akron Children\u2019s Hospital, Akron General Health System, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Summa Health System, The University of Akron and the John S. and James L.

Dr. Arthur Davidson, Director of Public Health Informatics, Denver Public Health<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I learned quickly working for Denver\u2019s public health department that when you have good and meaningful local data\u2014not just citywide data, but data broken down by neighborhood and city council districts\u2014people pay attention. There are 79 distinct neighborhoods and 11 council districts in Denver; to paint a picture of health, disease and challenges across the city, we ideally need to know and be able to share what is happening in each one of those neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>For example, with the help of several new data systems, we have identified that the childhood obesity rate is unequal and variable across neighborhoods.\u00a0 In some areas, the rate can be incredibly high and in others surprisingly low.\u00a0 We also are able to determine that those areas with higher childhood obesity rates tend to be communities with lower mean income, limited access to parks, and fewer healthy food options. Knowing this should change the way elected leaders make policy decisions or community advocacy groups focus investments in policies and systems that modify the environment.<\/p>\n<p>As a public health agency, we too make strategic decision around how we allocate limited public health resources across our jurisdiction. For example, with this type of information, Denver Public Health and Denver Environmental Health have been targeting areas for grocery store investments and building new parks for residents to become more physically active.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Expanding Access to and Use of Public Health Data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the last few years, with meaningful use investments in electronic health records (EHR), it has become clear that public health should be able to provide more localized data and conduct top notch health surveillance within even smaller areas.<\/p>\n<p>For some time, Kaiser Permanente (KP) in Colorado has been tracking outcomes for medical interventions among their enrolled members, with considerable success: they have some of the highest rates of blood pressure control in the nation. More recently, Denver Public Health, Denver\u2019s Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and other community health clinics have partnered with KP to create secure registries for sharing clinical information among healthcare providers, patients, public health organizations and communities.<\/p>\n<p>The registries will result in better health status monitoring, help target interventions, treat patients more appropriately, compare data across neighborhoods, and track outcomes. These collective registry efforts permit us to see what is and is not working on a population level beyond just the results of one particular healthcare provider or community intervention. Through EHR and other health information technologies, we can provide tailored individual health services while also informing policy, systems or environmental recommendations for specific communities.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the newly emerging Body Mass Index (BMI) registry, (funded by KP Community Benefit and The Colorado Health Foundation), will be able to map how BMI changes within schools or neighborhoods when more physical activity opportunities are introduced or as nutrition programs improve school meals. Through the registry, public health will be able to monitor how interventions help children be healthier, neighborhood by neighborhood, or make adjustments, if the intended outcome is not being observed.<\/p>\n<p>Another registry, on cardiovascular disease (CVD), supported by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Community Transformation Grant (CTG), gathers information from KP and Denver Health populations and tracks patient CVD risk factors (i.e., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, use of statins and tobacco status) across Denver\u2019s neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, with Master Tobacco Settlement funding, KP, Denver Health, Children\u2019s Hospital of Colorado, and several other FQHC are creating a state-wide tobacco use and cessation registry that will assist in sending e-referrals from the EHR to the Tobacco Quit-line and provide a feedback loop for measuring the impact of tobacco cessation programs.<\/p>\n<p>A fourth and most recently funded registry uses the same underlying infrastructure.\u00a0 This Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality project intends to combine KP and Denver Health data around mental health disease and map it for Denver County. In recent community health assessments, there was a dearth of information around mental health disparities by neighborhood. \u00a0This type of mental health registry could be a key resource for identifying the magnitude of mental health problems and where mental health services are needed most.<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In total, these registries will allow public health to better identify the areas of highest needs and engage patients and communities as partners in advocating for health improvements. With increasingly more complete registries, and superimposing environmental asset and barrier data, Denver should have a more thorough public health picture, which goes beyond merely stating the city\u2019s obesity rate but rather defining specific neighborhoods where the entire community can align resources to address a variety of policy, system and environmental barriers.<\/p>\n<p>More broadly, data may be used in a variety of ways. For instance, registries can inform public officials. By providing council members with information on their neighborhoods and the risks facing their constituents, they become more motivated to create policies which make the healthy choice the easy choice. Data can also be used to obtain support and investment from city agencies and departments by identifying which areas might benefit from better park maintenance or more effective street lighting, for example.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, going forward, we would like to produce these data and publish them so that community organizations, advocacy groups and other groups that care about communities can use the information to speak for people who might not have avenues to talk with policymakers.<\/p>\n<p>Superimposed on registry maps for behaviors, conditions or health, our goal is to map community assets and barriers. You might see that in neighborhood A there is a 40 percent obesity rate and neither recreation centers nor grocery stores and a low walkability index. While none of this will be earth shattering news, since we know how obesity relates to other socioeconomic determinants, we will be able to inform, create collective action and point people to solutions. Basically, we can show where health problems are occurring, which environmental assets are in place and what barriers to healthy choices exist.<\/p>\n<p>One other important use for the data is at the individual patient level. I was a family doctor at a community health center for more than 20 years. Often, in the 11 minutes I had to actually talk to a patient, I\u2019d say, \u201cyour weight is a bit high, you need to go out and exercise.\u201d It would have been helpful if I could generate a specific report from the EHR that uses these community asset mappings so the patient would receive a personalized prescription: \u201cif you walk following these specific street directions for x minutes, at this speed you\u2019ll burn 100 calories\u201d or \u201cif you go to this recreation center, you can do these exercises.\u201d One day, hopefully soon, the registry will be able to link directly to these types of interventions.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, the registries require massive input, resources and funding from different state and community level organizations. In essence, this work is dependent on effective and longstanding partnerships where a circle of trust has been established to share data.<\/p>\n<p>Much of this effort would not have happened without the key resources and partner organizations, including those involved in the Community Transformation Grant. The CTG has enabled us to move toward the goal of tying clinical data to the resources available in communities. This funding provides an opportunity for organizations to link rich clinical data on defined populations and correlate the health status observations with environmental and social factors\u2013that\u2019s pretty unusual. One day, that should be the new norm for public health and registries, as a monitoring system, should support both clinical and community interventions to improve the public\u2019s health.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/registry-colorado","date":"2013-11-05T03:58:39","modified":"2015-06-02T17:53:02","format":"standard","slug":"registry-colorado","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6851","excerpt":"<p>By, Dr. Arthur Davidson, Director of Public Health Informatics, Denver Public Health &nbsp; I learned quickly working for Denver\u2019s public health department that when you have good and meaningful local data\u2014not just citywide data, but data broken down by neighborhood and city council districts\u2014people pay attention.

Medical Officer, County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency, &amp; <strong>Lindsey McDermid<\/strong>, M.S., Community Transformation Grant Program Director, County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While, nationally, San Diego County has a reputation of a healthy population, more than 21 percent of the area\u2019s population is obese and another 37 percent are overweight.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2001, the Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) has looked for innovative ways to make the healthy choice the easy choice for everyone, and prevent obesity. In 2008, HHSA began planning for the first component of its <em>Live Well San Diego<\/em> 10-year initiative to create healthy, safe and thriving communities.<\/p>\n<p>To transform a community for the greatest impact, emphasis was placed on addressing the 3-4-50 principle: three behaviors (no physical activity, poor nutrition and tobacco use) contribute to four costly chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease and stroke, diabetes, and respiratory conditions such as asthma), which account for over 50 percent of deaths.\u00a0 Efforts also focused on building strategic and innovative partnerships aimed at making health an integral part of decisions made about transportation, education and other public policy areas that we know can benefit the health of a community. This \u201chealth in all policies\u201d approach underpinned the partnerships we formed with other County government departments.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time as we formed these partnerships, we also looked internally at HHSA chronic disease activities and developed an integrated plan to address chronic diseases \u2013 no longer did HHSA have siloed activities in different divisions and programs addressing different aspects of chronic diseases. There was now a coordinated approach, utilizing evidence-based interventions, to focus on a single outcome: creating healthy environments through upstream prevention. In total, public health resources were aligned to optimize impact and bring to bear resources from other government agencies to ensure policy was created and implemented with health in mind.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, none of this work could have lasted or been as successful without consistent and sustained funding. HHSA competed for and received two grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to promote healthy living. Initially, we focused on evidence-based interventions to promote nutrition and physical activity strategies that create healthy places, healthy foods and healthy schools.<\/p>\n<p>Then, with a Community Transformation Grant (CTG), funded through the Prevention and Public Health Fund, we continued to further chronic disease prevention by addressing the leading causes of chronic disease. The grants contributed to the very foundation of the <em>Live Well San Diego<\/em> health component \u2013 behavior risks \u2013 and grant interventions continue to combat the three behaviors that significantly contribute to chronic disease and death, by reducing tobacco use, increasing physical activity, and improving nutrition.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the CTG supports work with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), the regional Metropolitan Planning Organization, which was started to create opportunities for active transportation. Our work with SANDAG enables us to improve how we monitor active transportation \u2013 what gets measured gets counted \u2013 spreading complete streets to more neighborhoods, and supporting more Safe Routes to School.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, SANDAG made creating healthy communities one of the overarching goals of the Regional Plan \u2013 a 40-year guiding policy document for the region. This step represents a huge change in how the county approaches transportation decision-making and would not have been possible without the foundation laid through strategic partnerships and the resources initially provided by the grants.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, federal grants have supported us in working with the county\u2019s largest school district, San Diego Unified, to promote farm-to-school practices to increase access to local farms and agriculture. Through this initial partnership, San Diego Unified School District refined its food procurement processes to support purchasing local food. While typical procurement policies prioritize the cheapest food possible, now, the District\u2019s purchasing procedures prioritize the selection of local, healthier food. In addition, the District\u2019s school gardens are part of a garden-to-cafeteria program and a culinary garden agreement, established in partnership with our Department of Environmental Health, which enables produce from school gardens to be served in cafeterias.<\/p>\n<p>Within other county school districts, we have worked to increase the amount of physical activity students engage in during the school day. San Diego schools not only increased the percent of time students are physically active during physical education classes, but they also increased the length of physical education classes. Now, through our CTG, we are working with the Chula Vista Elementary School District to increase physical activity throughout the entire school day. By creating strong relationships with school administrators and training physical educators, the schools in this District are making systems and environmental changes to increase opportunities for physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond schools, a mini-grant program administered through SANDAG provided support to the City of San Diego staff to ease the permitting process for community gardens, and improve opportunities for urban agriculture. Furthered by the CTG, this work will be expanded to six additional jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>Because San Diego has the largest number of small farms in the country, it is important to leverage those resources by establishing a better local food system.\u00a0 Federal grants have helped create the Fresh Fund project at five Farmers Markets in high-need areas, which provided CalFresh (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), WIC, and SSI recipients with monthly matching funds to increase their ability to purchase fresh produce, with the profits going to local farmers. We also helped establish community gardens and education centers to educate San Diego residents about how to start their own community gardens. In addition, for those on food stamps, we provide education on the importance of nutrition, through support from the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program, created through the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 and funded by the United States Department of Agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>At HHSA, we\u2019re always looking to do more with less. One area we\u2019re hoping the CTG will help us address is strengthening the connection between primary care and public health. We recently developed a partnership through the CTG with the University of California, San Diego Right Care Initiative: Be There San Diego, where we\u2019re working to educate physicians on best practices for treatment of patients who have high blood pressure and cholesterol. We are also working to educate people about risks for heart disease and stroke, and increasing awareness about the need for timely and appropriate care. Long term, this partnership will connect patients with resources in the community that make healthy living easier.<\/p>\n<p>The CTG has also strengthened bonds with the rather large military presence in the county. We\u2019ve added a military representative to the CTG leadership team and have begun looking at that nexus of linking upstream prevention with military personnel and their families.<\/p>\n<p>For years, HHSA has focused on building a better health service delivery system, supporting and increasing healthy choices, pursuing policy and environment changes with health in mind, and improving the culture within government.\u00a0 Every county department and sector \u2013 public health, healthcare, schools, transportation, community- and faith-based organizations, business, education, military, city and tribal governments, \u00a0and others \u2013 are involved to support a culture of health in all policies that create healthy, safe, and thriving communities.\u00a0 Without federal support, we likely would not be able to continue or expand these efforts to ensure everyone who wants to be healthy can be in San Diego.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/transforming-a-community-with-health-in-mind","date":"2013-11-05T03:34:38","modified":"2015-06-02T18:04:10","format":"standard","slug":"transforming-a-community-with-health-in-mind","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6865","excerpt":"<p>By

Lisa Santora, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer, Beach Cities Health District<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Beach Cities Health District (BCHD) is a local primary prevention agency dedicated to creating a social environment that supports healthy behaviors in the communities of Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach. Our work aims to touch all 123,000 residents, from prenatal through adolescent to old age.<\/p>\n<p>Reaching every resident involves many community-level partners. In reality, we see our work as a localized National Prevention Council, which, at the national level, brought together 17 federal agencies\/departments to intentionally build health into all policy. So, locally, BCHD works with transportation, education, commerce, etc. to promote health everywhere. Somewhat surprisingly, we found partnerships with the fire and police departments to be incredibly fruitful in addition to the more \u201ctraditional\u201d partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>For example, we\u2019d never have been able to create safe walking routes to schools without the help of the police. BCHD brought together the department, the Parent Teacher Association, city engineers and others to identify the safest routes to school that also made sense for families and police department resources.<\/p>\n<p>Without the ability to bring these diverse, but necessary, partners together, we\u2019d never have the robust Safe Routes to School Program that we do now. This is exactly how we see our role: as an integrator of all the various resources that can and should be benefiting the health of the community. We are a successful integrator because of our historical and trusted relationships with the traditional healthcare community and other community organizations at large. Basically, we intentionally placed BCHD at the intersection of the healthcare system and community.<\/p>\n<p>As an integrator, we guide work with city governments, restaurants and others to create communities that make it easier for anyone who wants to be healthy do so. For example, we helped residents work toward an outdoor dining smoking ban and have actively advertised healthy messages.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, we\u2019ve seen smoking decline from 10.6 percent to 7 percent. In addition, 5.6 percent more Beach Cities residents reported engaging in regular exercise (at least 30 minutes, 3 times\/week) and 6.2 percent more residents reported eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables, on four or more days in the past week. In total, we have 1,645 fewer obese adults than we did in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>While we know there isn\u2019t a direct one-to-one casualty, clearly something is working and the savings on fewer smokers is enormous.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Supporting Healthy Behaviors throughout the Community<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2010, 28.9 percent of boys and 25.3 percent of girls entered kindergarten overweight or obese in school year 2011 to 2012. In addition, only 42.9 percent of fifth graders in Redondo Beach passed fitness measures.<\/p>\n<p>To address these systemic and life-threatening challenges, we created LiveWell Kids, an elementary school-based obesity prevention program that provides nutrition education, daily physical activity, funding for fresh fruits and vege\u00adtables in school meals and school-based gardens.<\/p>\n<p>We have also funded physical education specialists. BCHD-funded physical education specialists provide mentoring and guidance to general education teachers, who often receive little training, on how to effectively teach physical education lessons.<\/p>\n<p>Through increased walking, physical education, consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and other initiatives, there was a 37 percent reduction in obesity rates among the fifth graders participating in LiveWell Kids since the 2004-05 school year. In addition, students are getting 40 percent more physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>Going further, to reach children and families in neighborhoods, we created The Blue Zones Project, a community-wide initiative to improve the health and well-being of residents. By incorporating permanent, evidence-based environmental and policy changes, the project aims to make the healthy choice the easy choice and help residents live healthier, longer lives.<\/p>\n<p>For seniors, we employ seven social workers to work with older\/disabled adults to create care plans to provide support. We also partner directly with traditional healthcare organizations, most notably hospitals, to prevent readmissions. From the hospitals we learn of older adults who might benefit from home visits or even remodeling. Annually, BCHD organizes 200 community volunteers to provide wraparound care, friendly visits, run errands, and in-home personal training.<\/p>\n<p>We also have connected with fire departments, so that when they get calls for senior falls, their first call is to us, not necessarily the hospital. We can then provide the appropriate care and increase fall prevention to hopefully stop another fall from happening.<\/p>\n<p>Purposefully, Beach Cities Health District has become the largest preventive health agency in the nation. We intentionally focus on wellness, not sickness, to encourage people to make wiser health decisions.\u00a0 To that end, we offer comprehensive health and wellness programs, paired with innovative services and facilities to promote health and prevent diseases from prenatal to old age. As noted, our programs and services are aimed at making illness prevention an integral part of the classrooms, workplaces and homes of the beach cities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>As a public agency, BCHD is subsidized by district property taxes, program fees and healthcare business, lease and investment income. This forms the basis of our hybrid funding model, which enables us to return $4.79 to the community in services and programs for every tax dollar BCHD receives. Instead of relying on grants, we\u2019ve created a sustainable model of prevention.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/bchdpreventionstory","date":"2013-10-17T04:35:18","modified":"2015-06-02T17:22:41","format":"standard","slug":"bchdpreventionstory","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6779","excerpt":"<p>By, Lisa Santora, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer, Beach Cities Health District &nbsp; Beach Cities Health District (BCHD) is a local primary prevention agency dedicated to creating a social environment that supports healthy behaviors in the communities of Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach.

lack access to healthy food, it signals not only serious public health challenges, but lagging economic and community development. While improving access to nutritious and fresh foods addresses obstacles to healthy eating, it is only a partial solution for building a vibrant, local economy. How best, then, can we strengthen vulnerable neighborhoods that experience little community development and persistent food insecurity?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In our experience, this requires a holistic approach that addresses the needs of a community in the short- and long-term. Our work in New Orleans, where Broad Community Connections (BCC) and L+M Development Partners (L+M) recently broke ground on the ReFresh Project, is an example of doing just that: addressing multiple community needs at once. The ReFresh Project, a 60,000-square-foot adaptive reuse development, will include a new Whole Foods Market, Liberty\u2019s Kitchen\u2014a nonprofit with the dual purpose of providing culinary and life-skills training for at-risk youth and healthy meals for public schools\u2014and Tulane University\u2019s new Center for Culinary Medicine, a first-of-its kind teaching kitchen for community members, medical students, and practicing medical professionals.<\/p>\n<p>With ReFresh, our aim was not just to promote health by bringing better food options to residents, but to create a transformative project that would engage the community and anchor economic and community development in a historically underserved area of New Orleans. BCC and L+M perceived that the conventional wisdom on \u2018food deserts\u2019\u2014communities which lack access to fresh and affordable foods, and with a preponderance of unhealthy food options\u2014was incomplete; simply placing a fresh food retailer in an underserved community alone would not change the community\u2019s health. We wanted to provide educational programming and supportive services, new jobs and economic opportunities, and crucial resources that would help residents live healthier lives over the long-term. To that end, the ReFresh Project is the first development in the nation to house healthy and fresh food retail under the same roof as a broad range of organizations and programs designed to promote positive health outcomes and healthy behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>BCC describes this approach to community health as the Three Ps: <em>proximity<\/em>, or geographic access to healthy food within a community; <em>price<\/em>, or the affordability of fresh food, not only in terms of the sticker price, but also in the prevalence of support programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)<em>,<\/em> and <em>programming<\/em>, or a spectrum of educational opportunities and support services\u2014from cooking and nutrition classes, to exercise clubs and urban farming spaces, to developing a community health worker corps, to helping with WIC and SNAP registration, and shopping and budgeting assistance.<\/p>\n<p>The ReFresh project, which includes much-needed office and community space for health education programs that promote the vitality of the surrounding neighborhoods, will ensure that the Three Ps are met.\u00a0 Over time, the project aims to reduce the rates of chronic and diet-related disease in New Orleans, a city that suffers from some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the country, and make good on the conviction that the revitalization of a community should begin with the health of its residents.<\/p>\n<p>At BCC and L+M, we believe the ReFresh Project will play a key role in improving the health and vibrancy of some of New Orleans\u2019 most vulnerable neighborhoods. It is a destination that anchors small, local businesses in the broader corridor and complements large public and private investments in the area, including affordable housing. ReFresh is a national model for innovation in community development, public health, economic growth and education that centers on building healthier communities and increasing access to nutritious, delicious food.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/refresh-liif","date":"2013-10-17T02:51:33","modified":"2015-06-02T13:44:11","format":"standard","slug":"refresh-liif","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6770","excerpt":"<p>By Jeffrey Schwartz, Executive Director of Broad Community Connections and Robin Zimbler, Senior Project Manager at L+M Development Partners \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When neighborhoods lack access to healthy food, it signals not only serious public health challenges, but lagging economic and community development.

The state is receiving $1,945,289 to serve the entire state of Maryland minus large counties, an estimated population of 1,900,000.\u00a0 The State is dispersing this money to counties expanding efforts in tobacco-free living, active living and healthy eating and quality clinical and other preventive services.<\/p>\n<p>This is the kind of funding that will help Allegany and similar counties help people who want to get\/remain healthy and quit tobacco do so.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the CTG has funded a series of &#8220;Healthy Business&#8221; forums, where small businesses in less populous areas can learn about free resources and assistance, and hear from colleagues and neighbors who are successfully helping their employees be healthier. For some time, worksite wellness programs have been underused by small businesses.\u00a0 While large employers have the knowledge, resources and clout to implement worksite health promotion programs, small businesses, which are most affected by absenteeism and lost productivity, are significantly challenged.<\/p>\n<p>Both small and large businesses will improve from investments in prevention at the worksite and in the community. Research has shown that worksite health promotion programs reduce absenteeism by 27 percent\u2014which will help any business, large or small, increase productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Quite simply, community prevention is huge for small businesses. Community prevention provides a larger pool of healthier workers and dependents, and reduces absenteeism. In addition to the productivity boost, small businesses healthcare costs are community rated, and they can only get savings on costs if the entire community improves its health together. In short, by improving the health of the neighborhoods workers live in, businesses will reduce healthcare costs, even if those people accessing community wellness programs actually work for a different company!<\/p>\n<p>A comprehensive investment in proven community prevention is also important to larger business because they need the public health prevention infrastructure, as they have numerous employees working remotely that they only see intermittently and dependents whose healthcare they cover that they never see. So, providing a gym onsite won\u2019t scratch the surface of improving total employee and dependent wellness \u2013 you have to reach them where they live, learn and play.<\/p>\n<p>Community wellness is one of the most important investments a business of any size can make.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/community-wellness-a-surprisingly-important-business-investment","date":"2013-08-20T06:50:53","modified":"2015-06-02T18:02:24","format":"standard","slug":"community-wellness-a-surprisingly-important-business-investment","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6509","excerpt":"<p>By, John Miller, Executive Director, MidAtlantic Business Group on Health Like the rest of the country, Maryland businesses are feeling the sting of poor health.

According to the 2012 F\u00a0as in Fat report, if things continue on their current\u00a0course, the state\u2019s obesity rates could climb to 54.4\u00a0percent by 2030.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, nearly 30 percent of Iowa\u00a0adults have hypertension and 9.7\u00a0percent have diabetes. If we don\u2019t take\u00a0action, in the next 20 years, we could\u00a0see the number of new cases of type\u00a02 diabetes, heart disease and stroke,\u00a0hypertension, arthritis, obesity-related\u00a0cancer and other diseases continue\u00a0to rise, and obesity-related healthcare\u00a0costs could grow by 3.7 percent.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to do things\u00a0differently. One thing that has never\u00a0made sense is the disconnect between\u00a0the care patients receive in the\u00a0doctor\u2019s office and the lack of support\u00a0there is in communities to be able to\u00a0follow the doctor\u2019s advice in daily life.<\/p>\n<p>This is particularly important for\u00a0obesity and related health conditions.\u00a0For instance, a doctor finds a patient\u00a0has prediabetes. Unfortunately, there\u00a0is no special pill to prescribe as a cure,\u00a0but, rather, the prescription is making\u00a0better decisions about nutrition and\u00a0being more physically active. To\u00a0make the connection between the\u00a0clinical setting and daily life, Iowa\u2019s\u00a0local Community Transformation\u00a0Grant (CTG) projects are making it\u00a0easier for people who want to follow\u00a0the doctor\u2019s orders to do so in their\u00a0community by creating environments\u00a0that support access to healthy foods\u00a0and physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>To help connect individuals with community resources, we\u00a0launched the Iowa Community Referral Project so Iowans will\u00a0stay healthier longer and delay or avoid serious negative\u00a0health outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve partnered the Iowa Primary Care\u00a0Association (IPCA) and Local Boards\u00a0of Health so that doctors will now have\u00a0access and information about programs\u00a0in communities, and will be able to\u00a0refer and match their patients to those\u00a0resources. As part of our CTG, we are\u00a0bringing together partners, including\u00a0medical providers, local departments\u00a0of public health, community groups\u00a0and others to identify evidence-based\u00a0programs and efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Now, doctors in many counties will\u00a0have the information they need to\u00a0connect their patients with effective\u00a0programs. In essence, the prediabetic\u00a0patient will be able to receive a referral\u00a0from their doctor to programs in their\u00a0community that can help them get healthier and potentially avoid developing\u00a0diabetes. The Community Referral\u00a0Project connects individuals to\u00a0the entire spectrum of care \u2014 providing\u00a0patients with better opportunities\u00a0to follow their doctor\u2019s advice, whether\u00a0it be healthy eating, increased physical\u00a0activity or something else.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of some types of programs include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Black Hawk County Board of Health\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">has built a referral system that connects\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">members of the community with healthy\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">choices and better chronic disease self management.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">The evidence-based Stanford\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Chronic Disease Self-Management\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Program helps manage chronic conditions\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">such as diabetes or prediabetes\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">by empowering individuals to set personalized\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">goals for health improvement.

We\u2019ve received\u00a0two Safe Routes to School grants to\u00a0fix sidewalks, install new bike racks\u00a0and replace old signage around our\u00a0buildings. These improvements will<br \/>\nencourage students to walk and bike to\u00a0school, allowing them to start and end\u00a0their day school day in a healthier way.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that schools can also play a\u00a0big role in helping communities be\u00a0active all year round. That is why we\u2019ve\u00a0signed joint-use agreements with the\u00a0Perry County government to keep our\u00a0facilities open after hours and on the\u00a0weekends for all to enjoy. And it\u2019s not\u00a0just during the school year\u2014we keep\u00a0our gymnasiums open for several weeks\u00a0during the summer months as well.\u00a0In all of these instances, we\u2019ve made\u00a0certain to communicate openly and\u00a0directly with students, parents, faculty\u00a0and staff. We\u2019ve established school\u00a0health committees that meet regularly\u00a0to provide feedback on current\u00a0initiatives and propose new ones.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">We\u2019ve made significant changes to the\u00a0<\/span>nutrition content of the food we serve\u00a0to complement our physical activities.\u00a0We\u2019ve also received full commitment\u00a0and buy-in from our local board of\u00a0education members.<\/p>\n<p>I have been an educator for more\u00a0than three decades.

So I refuse to sit idly by\u00a0and watch this happen.

Carol Naughton, Senior Vice President, Purpose Built Communities<\/em><\/p>\n<p>For part one of the Purpose Built Community story, the history of East Lake, visit <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/purposefully-building-a-community-that-addresses-health-education-and-violence\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In 1995, East Lake Meadows was a community that consisted of 100 percent extremely low-income residents, distressed public housing, and a crime rate 18 times the national average. The community was poor (just 13 percent employment), under educated (just 5 percent of fifth graders met state math standards) and dangerous (90 percent of families were victims of a felony yearly).<\/p>\n<p>In East Lake, community groups partnered with one another and local government to focus on health and everything that affects health (jobs, infrastructure, housing, education, transportation, etc.). Now, the outcomes are very different. All of the adults in the Villages of East Lake work unless they are elderly or disabled.\u00a0 In 2013, 99 percent of the third through eighth-grade students in the neighborhood\u2019s Charles R. Drew Charter School passed the state assessment in reading, and 98 percent did so in math.\u00a0 The crime rate in East Lake is also dramatically lower, with a crime rate that is fifty percent of the average crime rate of the city of Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>The East Lake neighborhood has come a long way since the days when residents called it \u201cLittle Vietnam\u201d because it felt like a war zone. Over the last decade, thousands of people have visited East Lake to learn about the strategies used and see if they could replicate the outcomes in their own community. Purpose Built Communities was created by the founders of the East Lake Foundation to help other civic and business leaders to do precisely that \u2013 apply the model to create opportunities for families in struggling neighborhoods to break the cycle of poverty.\u00a0 Of course, replication isn\u2019t cookie cutter, but the same principles apply.\u00a0<em><a href=\"http:\/\/purposebuiltcommunities.org\/our-purpose\/our-purpose.html\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cAnyone could take this idea and make it work in any community. The model is there and the barrier has been broken.\u201d<\/a>\u00a0&#8211;<\/em>\u00a0Former U.N. Ambassador and Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young<\/p>\n<p>The Purpose Built model is a deep dive into a clearly-defined, narrowly-tailored geographic area \u2013 a neighborhood. Within that neighborhood, over a ten-year period, distressed low-income rental housing is replaced with high-quality mixed-income housing; a cradle-through-college education pipeline is created to serve the neighborhood; and wellness and health-related facilities and programs are implemented so that everyone in the neighborhood can be healthy, in the fullest sense of the term.<\/p>\n<p>These strategies are executed by many partners under the direction of a newly-created nonprofit organization \u2013 modeled on the East Lake Foundation \u2013 whose sole reason for existence is to make sure that the revitalization model is fully realized at very high standards. The new nonprofit, called a \u201clead organization\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily deliver programs itself, but serves as the quarterback of the initiative. The lead organization is the secret sauce in the Purpose Built Model.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Purpose Built Communities supports local leaders in eight cities who are already replicating this model, and is in discussions with leaders in 20 additional cities. Among those cities where work is already underway:<\/p>\n<p><strong>In New Orleans<\/strong>, the Bayou District Foundation is leading the revitalization of the former St. Bernard public housing community. Partners include neighborhood leaders and residents, the Housing Authority of New Orleans, Columbia Residential, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the YMCA, Orleans Parish Schools, the Recovery School District and others. \u00a0Louisiana State University is operating a health center in the neighborhood and an edible school yard project is underway.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Indianapolis<\/strong>, the Meadows Community Foundation and Strategic Capital Partners are leading the revitalization of the Meadows neighborhood. Partners include Sterling Development, the Indianapolis Housing Authority, Challenge Foundation Academy, Tinsley Accelerated Academy, Excel Academy and a unique health and wellness facility under construction that is a venture between the YMCA and HealthNet (a subsidiary of Indiana University Health).<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Spartanburg, South Carolina<\/strong>, the Northside Development Corporation is partnering with neighborhood residents, the City, the Spartanburg Housing Authority and Spartanburg School District 7 and others to revitalize the Northside of the city. One of the first projects is the construction of a new food hub, in partnership with the Butterfly Foundation, that will include a grocery store, community kitchen, urban farm and farmers\u2019 market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Birmingham<\/strong>, the Woodlawn Foundation is supporting Woodlawn United, a comprehensive redevelopment that will include new mixed-income housing, improved schools and increased health and wellness resources. A longstanding partner is the Christ Health Center that provides healthcare to residents of the community so that all may live an \u201cabundant\u201d life. Woodlawn United also includes the Jones Valley Teaching Farm whose mission is to make the community a healthier place by empowering future generations to eat smarter, think healthier and live better.<\/p>\n<p>The Purpose Built Communities Model creates healthy communities. Our approach to community redevelopment dramatically changes the social determinants of health. Research shows that people are healthier when they live in communities that include great quality housing, high quality education and opportunities for recreation and civic engagement. Those of us in the community development arena must marshal the existing resources in an effective way to create communities where the healthy choice is the easy choice.<\/p>\n<p>As our founder, Tom Cousins, says, \u201cEast Lake is <em>not <\/em>an exception. Neither is the Bayou District development in New Orleans or the Meadows Community development in Indianapolis. Come see for yourself. Then imagine what the impact would be if every city had a holistic, neighborhood-based, child-focused reformation effort going on in at least one of its own neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\u201d<\/p>\n<h6><\/h6>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/purposefully-building-a-community-that-addresses-health-education-and-violence\" target=\"_blank\">For part one of the Purpose Built Community story, the history of East Lake, visit here.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/other-communities-replicating-the-east-lake-model-to-address-health-education-and-violence","date":"2013-07-24T04:35:54","modified":"2015-06-02T18:01:37","format":"standard","slug":"other-communities-replicating-the-east-lake-model-to-address-health-education-and-violence","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6185","excerpt":"<p>By Carol Naughton, Senior Vice President, Purpose Built Communities For part one of the Purpose Built Community story, the history of East Lake, visit here.

feature on Purpose Built Communities and their model, visit here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Not long ago, East Lake Meadows, in Atlanta, Georgia, was known for its poverty.\u00a0 In 1995, 96 percent of residents were living in poverty, the employment rate was only 13.5 percent, the crime rate was 18 times higher than the national average, only 5 percent of fifth graders met state math standards, and less than one-third of teens graduated from school.<\/p>\n<p>Today, that neighborhood has been revitalized and is thriving.\u00a0 Household incomes have grown by 500 percent, violent crime has been reduced by 95 percent, 98.9 percent of fifth graders are meeting math standards and 97.9 percent meet reading standards. Seventy-eight percent of students who completed elementary school at the new neighborhood charter school graduate from high school, comparing favorably to Georgia\u2019s rate (67 percent) and Atlanta Public Schools at 52 percent. And that percentage is certain to grow given the new high school opening in East Lake in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>The revitalization of East Lake has been a long term initiative. I have been actively involved from the beginning, first as a lawyer with the Atlanta Housing Authority (AHA) from 1995 to 2001, and then as Executive Director of the East Lake Foundation, a nonprofit organization that worked with AHA, the residents of the community and other stakeholders to plan, implement and sustain the revitalization. In 2009, in response to a growing demand for solutions to intergenerational poverty, I helped form Purpose Built Communities, a nonprofit consulting firm affiliated with the East Lake Foundation that works with local leaders to implement our model of revitalization in neighborhoods around the country.<\/p>\n<p>This kind of success raises the obvious question: how did we do it?\u00a0 Early on, we realized that change would mean thinking differently.\u00a0 It would require a strong, committed group of public and private leaders to come together, to create partnerships and work across boundaries and interests, and to take shared responsibility toward common goals for the common good.\u00a0 The East Lake Foundation, a nonprofit created in 1995 specifically to lead the revitalization, spearheaded efforts, bringing together a range of public and private partners including neighborhood leaders, the Atlanta Housing Authority, Atlanta Public Schools, the Metro Atlanta YMCA and many others.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly realized that we could never build a strong neighborhood unless it was a healthy one.\u00a0 That no matter the goals we set for education or employment or crime reduction, they could not be achieved unless East Lake provided the opportunity for everyone to be as healthy as they can be, giving them the chance to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Health is a centerpiece of our strategies and our success. Our four primary strategies include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Replacing distressed, low-income, unhealthy housing with high quality mixed-income housing;<\/li>\n<li>Creating a cradle to college education pipeline;<\/li>\n<li>Bringing the community wellness partners\/programs together to create healthy sustainable neighborhoods; and<\/li>\n<li>Creating a newly formed non-profit with a single focus, called the lead organization, that drives and coordinates the revitalization.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>East Lake is now a vibrant community, and the initial return on investment has been remarkable.\u00a0 The direct benefits from redevelopment exceeded the initial capital outlay in the first two years \u2013 and, equally importantly, East Lake is now a highly desirable place for families to live.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Our Community\u2019s Wellness Center<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our first health and wellness partner in the revitalization was the East Lake Family YMCA. The Metro Atlanta YMCA operated a small facility a mile from East Lake that was about to close. \u00a0The East Lake Foundation invited the YMCA to build and operate a new YMCA as part of the rebuild of the East Lake neighborhood. The East Lake Foundation also helped forge a relationship between the YMCA and Drew Charter School, the new neighborhood school that would be built on an adjoining piece of land.<\/p>\n<p>Together, we raised money to build a new family YMCA: a 55,000 square foot facility that includes wellness space with weight rooms, pools, dance studios, and other multi-purpose areas. It includes community space for neighborhood meetings, fundraisers, weddings and dances. The YMCA, which was one of the first places in the neighborhood that brought people together across race and income, has become a multi-purpose community center. For example, seniors in the YMCA\u2019s \u201cSilver Fox Club\u201d take water aerobics in the morning and then socialize in the YMCA\u2019s caf\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2001, the East Lake Family YMCA has contracted with Drew Charter School to provide physical education classes including swimming lessons. This arrangement is a great use of both human and physical capital, keeping the YMCA and its staff busy all day long, unlike a typical YMCA, where most of the traffic is from 6:00-9:00 am and after 4:00 pm.<\/p>\n<p>The leadership of the Metro Atlanta YMCA took a chance on this new community partnership model. Their decision to invest in East Lake, and now other urban neighborhoods in Atlanta, grew from their commitment to serve areas that had historically been underserved by top flight institutions. Of the 18 YMCA\u2019s in metro Atlanta, East Lake has the third highest membership, which is offered on a sliding scale based on ability to pay. One of the most significant examples of the strength of the partnership is demonstrated by RC Pruitt, the Group Vice President of the Metro Atlanta YMCA, who says that he measures the success of the East Lake Family YMCA by how well children at Drew Charter School are doing academically, physically, emotionally and socially.<\/p>\n<p>Quite simply, the Metro Atlanta YMCA loves this model and is looking for more ways to partner with schools in the metro area. This partnership has also greatly benefited the Drew Charter School\u2014Drew didn\u2019t have to build a gym because the YMCA was the physical education partner for the school. So, instead of a small gym with limited programs, children have access to a large, first-class facility lead by top quality professionals.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Healthy Children + a Healthy School = a Healthy and Happy Community<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For years, a local office of PricewaterhouseCoopers has assembled bicycles as part of team building exercises and donated them to Drew Charter School. Drew used the bikes to reward academic progress, good behavior and other accomplishments.\u00a0\u00a0 This led to the creation of a bike club that meets on Saturdays to ride through Atlanta. Drew added bike racks to accommodate children who started riding their bikes to school. In addition, many seventh graders participate in the \u201cBike Ride Across Georgia\u201d every year. What started with just a few donated bikes has grown into an unintentional health movement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">We were more intentional about other aspects of student health at Drew. During every school day, each child gets recess and, three times per week, students take physical education. We also have a robust walk-to-school program and healthier school foods in meals and vending machines. Quite simply, wellness is integrated in the school culture. It\u2019s part of a Drew education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Recently we had visitors to our school. We asked them \u201cWhat do you notice?\u201d Their first answer:\u00a0 \u201cThe kids aren\u2019t fat.\u201d\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">Beyond physical\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">activity, our comm<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">unity has addressed systemic child health issues. When we started our work, many children missed school because of asthma. So, we partnered with Children\u2019s Health Care of Atlanta to reduce incidences of asthma by helping children and their families better manage their condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<div>\n<p>And, because Drew is a charter school, it decides where to spend its money. The school elected to fund a school nurse, a social worker, and counselor as full-time employees. Drew has also worked with psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinical pastoral counselors when a student needed that level of support.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen health change for the better:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A dramatic reduction in number of obese and overweight children;<\/li>\n<li>Fewer children missing more than 10 days of school;<\/li>\n<li>Fewer children with asthma; and<\/li>\n<li>Fewer teen pregnancies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">A Neighborhood Purposefully Built with Health in Mind<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the beginning of the revitalization, we knew it was important to make East Lake a walkable and friendly to outdoor exercise and biking. We built wide, well-lit sidewalks \u2013 in fact, there are separate street lights that shine just on the sidewalks. This neighborhood feels like a campus, and the design encourages walking from place to place.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the mixed-income housing was built intentionally around the new public \u00a0Charlie Yates Golf Course, the home of the First Tee of East Lake\u00a9, a youth development program that uses the game of golf to not only provide recreation, but to help the kids develop life skills.<\/p>\n<p>For 40 years, East Lake residents had to go miles (through dangerous areas) to reach a grocery store. Early in the revitalization, the East Lake Foundation purchased land in hope of attracting a large grocery chain. By the time the mixed-income housing was complete, the Foundation had entered into an agreement with Publix to build a store on the land across the street from the apartments. Publix opened in November 2001 and now we have an accessible source of fresh, affordable foods.<\/p>\n<p>We also converted spaces that once held fast food into green spaces and ensured there were ample playgrounds and open spaces in the neighborhood. In fact, the athletic field at the Villages of East Lake is the home pitch for the YMCA\u2019s soccer league.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, \u00a0in July 2010, the East Lake Foundation and its partners founded the East Lake Community Learning Garden as a safe, supportive environment where neighborhood residents grow organic produce in a small urban farm and participate in interactive workshops while learning from one another and gardening experts.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Little Changes Make a Huge Difference<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After years of study, it is clear there is no silver bullet to the obesity epidemic, community violence or underperforming schools. None of the individual actions we took would have addressed these systemic problems on their own. But, cumulatively, each initiative, program and investment has provided a huge benefit at both the individual and community levels.<\/p>\n<p>Today, East Lake is a thriving neighborhood, with all children and families living in better quality and healthier housing, with nearby facilities geared toward their continued well-being. There are no vermin or toxins that trigger dangerous health episodes. Drew students, YMCA members and neighborhood residents cross paths and get to know one another while working together in the garden or cheering for Drew\u2019s athletic and academic teams. People across a broad range of incomes play tennis and golf at the neighborhood facilities. They congregate in Drew Charter School and the YMCA to work to make East Lake a better place.<\/p>\n<p>Our model worked for East Lake \u2013 our children are healthier, performing better in school and happier. This revitalized neighborhood is vibrant and safer. As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said when citing East Lake as a successful model, &#8220;\u2026 substantial coordination and dedication, [can]\u2026 break through silos to simultaneously improve housing, connect residents to jobs, and help ensure access to adequate nutrition, health care, education, and day care.\u201d That is the big picture vision that transformed East Lake and is now working in a growing number of cities to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty so that geography no longer limits human potential.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/other-communities-replicating-the-east-lake-model-to-address-health-education-and-violence\" target=\"_blank\">For part II of the feature on Purpose Built Communities and their model, visit here.<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/purposefully-building-a-community-that-addresses-health-education-and-violence","date":"2013-07-23T04:20:10","modified":"2015-06-02T18:01:46","format":"standard","slug":"purposefully-building-a-community-that-addresses-health-education-and-violence","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=6097","excerpt":"<p>By Carol Naughton, Senior Vice President, Purpose Built Communities For part II of the feature on Purpose Built Communities and their model, visit here.

J.T. Lane, Assistant Secretary for Public Health, State of Louisiana and\u00a0Gerrelda Davis, Director of Primary Care and Rural Health, State of Louisiana<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In late 2011, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation (BCBSLF) issued their \u201cChallenge for\u00a0 a Healthier Louisiana,\u201d which would ultimately award between $250,000 and $1,000,000 to communities that match the grants and focus on increasing healthy eating and active living.<\/p>\n<p>At about the same time, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) Office of Public Health was applying for a Community Transformation Grant (CTG), which is targeted at addressing the leading causes of chronic diseases to improve the health of Americans and reduce health care costs through policy, environmental and infrastructure changes.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly there were synergies between our proposed work and that of BCBSLF\u2013the CTG and Challenge for a Healthier Louisiana created the perfect opportunity to truly leverage resources and bring to bear enough funding and expertise to address the chronic conditions that are hurting our state.<\/p>\n<p>When we applied for the CTG, we asked for a representative from Blue Cross and Blue Shield to be part of our leadership team. To bring about community change, we knew we had to have all aspects of the community (from primary care to education to transportation) invested. With thought leaders from all that impacts health, we would have the best opportunity to reach more people where they live, learn, work and play.<\/p>\n<p>BCBSLF then invited experts from the DHH Office of Public Health to participate in their grant process, asking Public Health to review applications. With these informal, but necessary, partnerships in place, in early 2012, DHH met with the foundation to discuss a formal partnership. Our two organizations eventually signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and our work began. One significant portion of the MOU is a data-sharing component to align all different health data streams to be used to inform decision-making so we make targeted investments in prevention initiatives for the most serious conditions facing communities.<\/p>\n<p>It was a challenge for DHH to reach the entire state with the CTG, but with BCBSLF we can reach more Louisianans and better leverage resources. In addition, DHH has unique expertise, given our knowledge and work with communities\/parishes, that provides a tremendous value to the Challenge for a Healthier Louisiana. Together, we are fighting chronic conditions with place-based strategies\u2014i.e., where people live, learn, work and play\u2014to make the healthy choice the easy choice throughout communities.<\/p>\n<p>Through the new grants, we provide communities with the skills, tools and resources to improve the health of their residents. We are empowering communities to make the decisions they know will benefit their neighborhoods\u2014after all, every person and thus every community is different, making community organizations the best positioned to know what will work for their members.<\/p>\n<p>Together, we are focusing on healthy lifestyles, physical activity, health education, access to safe places to play and exercise, and healthy nutrition. For example, the West End Health and Wellness Project in New Iberia is opening a fresh seafood and farmer\u2019s market in the city\u2019s West End.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the reach of DHH and BCBSLF, this partnership is the blueprint for the future of public health in Louisiana. While DHH has had similar relationships in the past, this is the first time we\u2019ve been able to leverage so much funding and grant dollars, which makes it an incredibly exciting partnership. This approach is in tune with what the future of public health should look like\u2014maximizing public and private sector investments and empowering communities to take charge of their health.<\/p>\n<p>In Public Health in Louisiana, we are also looking to strengthen partnerships with our local parishes. We see our long-term role focused on serving as chief health strategist for the state, meaning we\u2019ll provide the expertise and resources for our parishes, communities and neighborhoods, but let them lead the development of local solutions to their major health problems.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, recently Calcasieu Parish hired a health coordinator to bring together community groups, including faith-based organizations, and marshal resources to provide opportunities for healthy living. When speaking with another parish, we shared this idea and they immediately got excited and began looking for funding opportunities to make this happen. We want to replicate this excitement and approach in all 64 parishes.<\/p>\n<p>Quite simply, Public Health can identify the best strategic investments and be the technical advisor to drive innovation locally and health improvement across the state. To get the most out of every dollar we invest, we need less episodic and siloed investments. For instance, our great capital city, Baton Rouge, has more than 100 different programs (all funded differently) that address obesity. These need to be harmonized to work together. When that happens, return on investment will be greater and we\u2019ll have no duplication of efforts.<\/p>\n<p>The future of our agency is that of chief health strategist for our state \u2013 we will work side-by-side with local communities and our parishes to build expertise and capacity and leverage all dollars available, creating a far more comprehensive approach. In five years, ten years and twenty years, our state and our people\u2019s health will be the better for it.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/the-future-of-public-health-in-louisiana-strategic-partnerships-that-empower-communities","date":"2013-05-15T09:30:09","modified":"2015-06-02T17:54:56","format":"standard","slug":"the-future-of-public-health-in-louisiana-strategic-partnerships-that-empower-communities","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=5558","excerpt":"<p>By, J.T.

Reducing and controlling obesity is a key focus. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaa.com\/inet\/pages\/insurance_life_main?akredirect=true\" target=\"_blank\">USAA <\/a>researchers found that obesity is behind a significant amount of the company\u2019s health care spending. \u201cHealth care is always a big chunk of your labor costs,\u201d Wald said. \u201cWith obesity, health care costs have the potential to really go up.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaa.com\/inet\/pages\/insurance_life_main?akredirect=true\" target=\"_blank\">USAA<\/a> offers employees a variety of inducements to get healthy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employees pay $300 a year to use company fitness centers, which are in almost every company building. But workers who go once a week for a year get 25 percent off; those who go twice a week get half off; those who go three or more times a week get 75 percent off.<\/li>\n<li>USAA has built running and walking trails and paths at many of its campuses, and painted mileage markers in company hallways to encourage indoor walking. In company cafeterias, healthy food is at eye level, while food that\u2019s bad for you is lower down \u2014 the opposite approach taken by many supermarkets. Healthy items have a prominent green tag.<\/li>\n<li>In 2008, the program added weight loss and other health incentives; employees who meet requirements can earn up to $550 a year. USAA also offers lower health insurance premiums for improving health; single workers can save up to $300, while those with dependents can save as much as $950.<\/li>\n<li>In company cafeterias, pricing encourages workers to buy healthy food, water costs $1.25, while soda is $1.50; a turkey burger costs slightly less than a beef burger; and a veggie burger costs less than a turkey burger. \u201cWe keep track of consumption,\u201d Wald said. \u201cIt works.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The incentives have contributed to increased weight loss, improved health measurements and decreased costs.

Knight Foundation. Not surprisingly, this partnership mirrors the Akron and Summit county communities, as healthcare and education are the region\u2019s largest economic sectors.<\/p>\n<p>Our region is also home to a vital community, with an extensive park system that includes biking, hiking and running trails, cross-country skiing, lakes and much more.<\/p>\n<p>However, in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which encompasses Summit County, 10.8\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">percent of the population has been diagnosed with diabetes, with an additional 2.1 percent reporting pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes as a diagnosis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This compares to a rate of 10.1 percent for the state of Ohio and 8.3 percent for the United States.<\/p>\n<p>With regard to diabetes-related risk factors in the Akron MSA, 24.8 percent of the population reports no physical activity in the past month; and 77.7 percent of adults consume less than the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. In addition, 37.3 percent of adults are overweight, and 30.4 percent are obese.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, The Akron MSA represents an at-risk community that would benefit from health interventions.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the region\u2019s and nation\u2019s need for a collaborative and shared approach to community health, about 18 months ago, ABIA\u2019s Center for Community Health Improvement began the effort to usher in a new health culture in the Akron region by developing an Accountable Care Community (ACC), a new health model which aims to foster collaborations borne of shared responsibility among various sectors to transform health in Northeast Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>The ACC is a collaborative, integrated, and measurable strategy that focuses on health promotion and disease prevention, access to quality services, and healthcare delivery. As such, the ACC is not dependent upon healthcare systems adopting specific public or private payer initiatives. Rather, it builds on initiatives to encompass not only the area\u2019s medical care providers, but also the public health system and community stakeholders whose work, taken together, spans the spectrum of the determinants of health. In addition, the ACC focuses on health outcomes of the entire population of a defined geographic region, i.e., Summit County, OH instead of silos of populations of health consumers selected by a health insurance entity or provider participant.<\/p>\n<p>When we developed the ACC, it was important to fundamentally change health and health care delivery from silos to a more integrated and coordinated system that utilizes existing resources in the community, for example: concepts such as patient-centered medical home, care coordination, shared accountability, collective impact, and value-based payment.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, the ACC model is structured around the following components:<\/p>\n<p>(1) Development of integrated medical and public health models that deliver clinical care in tandem with health promotion and disease prevention efforts;<\/p>\n<p>(2) Utilization of interprofessional teams including, but not limited to, medicine, pharmacy, public health, nursing, social work, mental health, and nutrition to align care management and improve patient access and care coordination;<\/p>\n<p>(3) Collaboration among health systems and public health, to enhance communication and planning efforts;<\/p>\n<p>(4) Development of a robust health information technology infrastructure, to enable access to comprehensive, timely patient health information that facilitates the delivery of appropriate care and execution of effective care transitions across the continuum of providers;<\/p>\n<p>(5) Implementation of an integrated and fully mineable surveillance and data warehouse functionality, to monitor and report systematically and longitudinally on the health status of the community, measuring change over time and assessing the impact of various intervention strategies;<\/p>\n<p>(6) Development of a dissemination infrastructure to rapidly share best practices;<\/p>\n<p>(7) Design and execution of a robust ACC implementation platform and impact measurement tool; and<\/p>\n<p>(8) Policy analysis and advocacy to facilitate ACC success and sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Significant progress has been made within the initial 18 months of designing, developing, and implementing the ACC. After analyzing and evaluating the needs to improve population health, we identified diabetes as the initial priority. We focused on the spectrum of health promotion and diabetes prevention, diabetes self-management, secondary and tertiary prevention of diabetes complications, and the care and services of individuals currently living with diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>ABIA was positioned as the hub for the development and execution of the ACC including series of targeted, multi-party interventions.<\/p>\n<p>The first project encompassed a cohort of individuals with diabetes who were linked to care and services within the ACC. Available to each of the individuals, based upon their needs, was augmented medical care, programs and initiatives for self-management, and secondary and tertiary prevention. These included diverse interventions such as education for self-care, nutrition, physical activity, mindfulness for social and emotional wellness, among many others.<\/p>\n<p>After we linked these individuals with community resources, we found beneficial health outcomes and cost of care outcomes, showing improvements in biometrics e.g., reduction in weight and\/or waist measurement, decline in blood sugar and increase in self-reported fitness levels. In addition, we have found an approximate 10 percent cost savings in the utilization of care for these individuals.<\/p>\n<p>The second project focused on a diabetes self-management program that was an educational and\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">experiential program in a small group setting with participants drawn from diverse practice sites. For this cohort, studied microscopically, over a six month period, we found that those individuals born before 1965 (baby boomers and older) were the most successful at decreasing their BMI, and lost an average of 2.166 points of BMI. For all individuals, overall, they showed a decrease in their Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) percentage by approximately 0.45, with no differences by age, generation, race, and limitations. This decrease showed their diabetes is better controlled and also led to an estimated savings of $3,185 per\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">person, per year in medical costs. In addition, from the decrease in body weight, medical care costs, and losses from work, the cost of absenteeism decreased by $580 per person, year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a group, the number of emergency department visits was also lower during this period when compared to the six months prior. We have compared our findings to national findings, and the cost of our programs and our improved health and cost savings are well ahead of the norm. The analysis not only demonstrated the biometric successes of the program, but also reduced costs and improved overall individual community health. These data show that through an ACC positive outcomes along the Triple Aim (improving the individual experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of care for populations, according to Health Affairs) can be achieved.<\/p>\n<p>As we move forward, with the support of the ABIA partners and an expanding network of community stakeholders, the ACC will enable Akron and Summit County, Ohio to become a guiding force for better health across all portions of our society.<\/p>\n<p>In February, 2012, we released an ACC White Paper (available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.abiakron.org\/Data\/Sites\/1\/pdf\/accwhitepaper12012v5final.pdf\">http:\/\/www.abiakron.org\/Data\/Sites\/1\/pdf\/accwhitepaper12012v5final.pdf<\/a>), which has received more than 50,000 hits to the website, with over 15,000 downloads, and approximately 200 direct contacts. These direct contacts are inquires referencing working with health systems, universities, public health entities, local governments, and so forth to develop and implement an ACC in their communities. Quite simply, our ACC model of shared responsibility can be implemented and adapted for other communities throughout the nation.<\/p>\n<p><em>Other communities around the U.S have implemented smaller initiatives around community-based approach to care with promising results.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Some examples include the Sagadahoc (Maine) Health Improvement Project, the Community Care of North Carolina Program and the Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q).

for ways to improve the vitality \u2014 particularly the economic vitality \u2014 of the community, leaders in Akron, Ohio identified health issues \u2014 particularly high rates of chronic disease and related health care costs \u2014 as a major concern.<\/p>\n<p>The nonprofit ABIA brought together a wide range of 70 different groups to launch the first-of-its-kind Accountable Care Community in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The ACC is focused on improving the health of the community and incentivizing the health care system to reward improved health while delivering cost effective care. Success is measured by factors including the improved health of the whole community, cost effectiveness and cost savings in the health care system, improved patient experience for those using the health care system and job creation in Akron.<\/p>\n<p>The effort began by zeroing in one of the most widespread, high cost preventable health problems in their community: type 2 diabetes. Approximately 11 percent of adults in Akron have diabetes, and 2.1 percent more are considered pre-diabetic and are at risk for developing full blown diabetes.42 If current trends continue, one-third of the Akron population could have diabetes by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>Of the individuals with type 2 diabetes involved in Akron\u2019s ACC, around 38 percent have private health insurance, 31 percent have public health insurance (Medicare or Medicaid) and 31 percent have no health insurance. People with diabetes have 2.3 times higher average medical costs per year than non-diabetics.<\/p>\n<p>Effective approaches to prevent and control diabetes require a comprehensive approach.<\/p>\n<p>Strong, regular medical care, including coverage for care, is important. But, daily self-management is also essential for individuals with diabetes. And, maintaining a healthy diet and levels of physical activity are also necessary to help those with diabetes improve their health and prevent others from developing diabetes in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>There is recognition that health care must focus on improving the overall health of individuals, which requires thinking about their direct care but also how to coordinate maintaining health outside the doctor\u2019s office. Managing health in daily life requires having information about nutrition and activity and proper self-management education for those who are living with health conditions. In addition, it is important to make healthy choices easier in people\u2019s daily lives. This includes easier access to affordable healthy food, safe and convenient places for physical activity, mental and emotional support, and encouragement and incentives from employers, family, community- and faith-organizations and others.<\/p>\n<p>The ACC built a collaboration to leverage the resources and ideas of a wide range of organizations, including the major hospitals and health care providers, employers, the Chamber of Commerce, universities, housing groups, transportation groups, economic developers and planners, a range of faith-based organizations and many others. Some of the activities and initiatives, in addition to those directly related to education and care for disease, have included community gardens, fresh food preparation, fit-minute exercise, among others.<\/p>\n<p>Akron has worked on the following initiatives: (1) expansion of the concept of \u201cpublic lands for public health\u201d with the Cuyahoga Valley National Park \u2014 including extending public transportation such as bus lines to make the park more accessible to more members of the community; (2) a regional health impact assessment of the Akron Marathon; (3) partnerships with the faith-based community for health education and screening for individuals who are underserved including refugees and Native-Americans; and (4) work with the Akron Metropolitan Transportation System to better understand how to design or redesign systems transportation and the built environment to provide increased opportunities access safe places for physical activity and healthy, affordable food options.<\/p>\n<p>The initiative also received a CTG from CDC to help support their activities. CTGs are awarded to communities that are taking integrated, evidence-based approaches to preventing disease. ABIA received a $500,000 per year for five years capacity-building grant in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The three major community health systems, the Akron Children\u2019s Health System, Akron General Health System, and Summa Health System and many private provider groups in Akron participate in the ACC.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Combined, around 80 percent of all of the county\u2019s population are represented through participating hospitals, providers and social service agencies. The initiative recognizes that knowledge and information management is essential to understanding and analyzing health and cost patterns. They have developed systems for confidential sharing of patient data using an integrated data platform, which allows for the consistent and com parable analysis of data to be able to track health trends and cost savings. Participating hospitals and providers receive a share of the health care cost savings achieved by the program, and other funds are reinvested in the ACC or other community efforts.<\/p>\n<p>In just 18 months, the initiative is already seeing positive results:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The average cost per month of care for individuals with diabetes was reduced by more than 10 percent per month; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">After one year of involvement, consistent reductions in costs are in excess of 25 percent. Other key highlight outcomes include:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li>Estimate program savings of $3,185 per person per year;<\/li>\n<li>More than half of participants lost weight (115 pounds), decreased decreased body mass index (BMI) (almost 23 points), and reduced waist size (more than 25 inches);<\/li>\n<li>Lowered cost per person per contact hour with health care providers ($25 vs. $37.50 for other leading diabetes prevention programs);<\/li>\n<li>Better management leading to decrease in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) (a measure of diabetes) and LCL cholesterol (often known as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) levels;<\/li>\n<li>No amputations because of diabetes;<\/li>\n<li>Decline in emergency department visits because of diabetes: a drop from nine to six emergency room visits for people in the higher glycated hemoglobin ranges (HbA1c&gt;8%); and a drop from six to three visits for people in the lower glycated hemoglobin ranges (HbA1c&lt;8%); and<\/li>\n<li>Increase in reported exercise and flexibility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The ACC has been successful in improving quality of care, lowering the cost of treatment, delaying the progression of disease, expanding the population receiving comprehensive care, reducing the overall burden of disease in the community, and increasing productivity. The initiative is planning to expand to focus on additional health problems, such as asthma. Akron is a healthier place with lower health care costs because of the ACC, and it is more attractive to businesses and other groups because of its more vibrant and productive workforce.<\/p>\n<p>ABIA developed the ACC model so it could be replicated in other communities around the country, and has had more than 200 requests for more information or consultation from other communities.<\/p>\n<h4 align=\"center\"><strong>Austen BioInnovation Institute in Akron<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>ABIA is a unique biomedical innovation institute, founded in 2008 by Akron Children\u2019s Hospital, Akron General Health System, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Summa Health System, The University of Akron and the John S. and James L.

when Regina Stout is walking to work through Ashland, a town of 25,000 in the northeastern corner of Kentucky, a friendly driver will pull over and ask her if she needs a ride somewhere. The neighborhood she walks through is nice, and the distance is short \u2014 eight blocks from her front door to her office.<\/p>\n<p>People in Ashland just aren\u2019t used to seeing pedestrians.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re surprised to hear that I\u2019m walking by choice,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Every time this happens, she realizes again just how much work she has ahead of her. Stout, the executive director of the Kentucky Heart Foundation, is in charge of a new project to reduce obesity in Ashland, as well as in surrounding Boyd County and neighboring Greenup County.<\/p>\n<p>The area has one of the highest obesity rates in Kentucky, which is itself one of the heaviest states in the country. More than three quarters of the area\u2019s 86,000 residents are overweight or obese and a third get no exercise at all. Not surprisingly, diabetes, heart disease and stroke are common.<\/p>\n<p>A 2009 study of children in after-school programs in the two counties found that half were overweight or obese and three percent had high blood pressure\u2014 a very high number for that age group.<\/p>\n<p>The area\u2019s health crisis has many causes, but Stout and other experts say that a good part of the problem stems from the physical environment: the plethora of fast-food restaurants, the lack of adequate grocery stores, and the dearth\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">of places to walk and bicycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In both counties, fast food is almost the only option for people who want to buy a cooked meal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have one restaurant that\u2019s not fast food in Greenup County,\u201d said Scarlet Shoemaker, who oversees the program in that county. That exception is a family-owned place that serves homecooked meals, most of which are high in calories.<\/p>\n<p>Neither county has many supermarkets or grocery stores that sell fresh fruits, vegetables, and other healthy fare. Except for the city of Ashland, which has some buses, the area has no public transportation, so anyone without a car has an especially hard time buying nutritious food. Greenup County has just three supermarkets; these stores are on one side of the county, which means that some people must drive an 80 miles round trip to get fresh lettuce or oranges. Otherwise they must rely on smaller stores that stock only small quantities of fresh food, and tend to charge more for what they do offer. In Wurtland, a town of 1,000 in Greenup County, residents have only a Dollar General store, which carries a limited selection of packaged food, snacks, and soft drinks. The closest supermarket is five miles away.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAvailability is a big issue, and price is a big issue,\u201d said Shoemaker. \u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Poverty plays a major role in the area\u2019s high obesity rate. The two counties\u2019 per capita income is just over $26,000, and many families must get by on much less. In recent years, many of the region\u2019s industries, such as coke processing and steel manufacturing, have shut down or downsized, and unemployment is high. Increasingly, residents survive by taking low-paying service jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Stout said many people tell her they just don\u2019t have enough money to buy fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHealth is not a priority,\u201d said Shoemaker. \u201cFor a lot of families, a bigger priority is just getting a paycheck and getting food on the table, regardless of quality. You can buy a lot more chips than you can fresh vegetables. People\u2019s weight is not usually on the radar.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another problem: the region does not make it easy for those who want to be physically active. Few areas have streets with sidewalks, and there are not many walking trails; most of those can only be reached by car. \u201cMostly there are two-lane curvy roads with a ditch on either side,\u201d said Shoemaker, who works as the director of school safety and public relations for the Greenup school district. The terrain itself discourages many from exercising. The area is in the Appalachian foothills, and walking the steep hills and valleys can be difficult, especially for those who are already overweight and out of shape.<\/p>\n<p>The region\u2019s culture also plays a role. Stout said people in Greenup, Boyd, and throughout Appalachia tend to fry their food, eat a lot of lard and other fats, and not pay too much attention to health or weight.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">In an era when nearly everyone did physical labor, and many meals included home-grown vegetables, these practices weren\u2019t such a problem. But now, with significantly fewer opportunities to burn calories, and the disappearance of backyard gardens and home canning, these habits are contributing to the region\u2019s high obesity and chronic disease rates<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Last year, a coalition of 26 local groups, led by the Kentucky Heart Foundation, started an effort to reduce obesity in Boyd and Greenup. The goals: to increase kids\u2019 level of physical activity, teach them about good nutrition, and encourage healthier eating. Called Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities, the group (not to be confused with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation program of the same name) includes county and city governments, school districts, the public health and medical community, and nonprofit groups. The initiative received a three-year, $75,000 grant from a consortium of national groups and government agencies, including CDC, the YMCA, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the program has worked with schools to institute an \u201cactive recess\u201d policy for the two counties\u2019 12 elementary schools. In the past, recess in Boyd and Greenup often involved very little actual activity. Especially in late fall and winter, students typically spent recess in classrooms, talking or watching movies. Even when recess was outside, many kids didn\u2019t exercise much. In addition, many teachers punished students for bad behavior by restricting recess time or using the time for schoolwork.<\/p>\n<p>To help kids move more, the coalition bought exercise equipment, including jump ropes, hula hoops, and balls, for the two school districts. Elementary school PE teachers received information on how to make recess more active.<\/p>\n<p>Shoemaker summed up the new policy succinctly: \u201cEverybody moves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the group is working with the school districts to improve the quality of school meals. Shoemaker said that in Greenup, school cafeterias are already doing a lot more baking than frying. Still, she said, the food could include more fresh fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n<p>The coalition is now talking with local governments about the possibility of introducing Complete Streets laws, which would require more bike lanes and sidewalks. And it is talking with some employers about starting wellness programs, which encourage workers to exercise more and eat better.<\/p>\n<p>In the future, the coalition wants to build more trails and bike paths. Each county now has one walking trail. Ashland has a bike route, but Stout says it\u2019s not as safe or as continuous as she\u2019d like: riders have to get off their bikes and walk to get across several busy intersections.<\/p>\n<p>She hopes to eventually expand the project to surrounding counties, which will present an even larger challenge. These areas are deeper in Appalachia than Boyd and Greenup, and have higher obesity and poverty rates, and even fewer supermarkets and sidewalks. But before moving on to that challenge, she\u2019ll have to convince the drivers in Ashland that being a pedestrian isn\u2019t something out of the ordinary.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2011FasInFatExcerpt85KY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/boyd-and-greenup-counties-in-rural-kentucky-limited-access-to-healthy-food","date":"2013-02-23T14:53:39","modified":"2015-06-02T17:54:47","format":"standard","slug":"boyd-and-greenup-counties-in-rural-kentucky-limited-access-to-healthy-food","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4841","excerpt":"<p>Sometimes when Regina Stout is walking to work through Ashland, a town of 25,000 in the northeastern corner of Kentucky, a friendly driver will pull over and ask her if she needs a ride somewhere.

Kim Stroud, Benefits Manager, Manatee County<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Manatee County has 3,200 employees, or, as we think of it, 6,900 lives, including families.<\/p>\n<p>In early 2000, our health care costs were skyrocketing, mostly due to chronic conditions. At the time, the county was covering the entire share of the employee premium, but this became untenable. We had a decision to make: how do we continue to fund the increase in health care and do we continue to absorb those costs ourselves or do we shift them to the employee through premium increases or require more employee out of pocket expenses through the benefit design?<\/p>\n<p>We knew both choices had their minuses, so we did neither. Starting in 2006, we created the YourChoice Health Plan, which ties preventive health care and evidenced-based practices with employee plan level eligibility. The plan is a traditional PPO, but within it, we have four levels. The highest level, or the Ultimate plan, requires only a copay for office visits and hospitalization is paid at 100 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially the member pays only approximately six percent of a claim. However, we didn\u2019t allow employees to simply get into the plan. To qualify, employees had to take a comprehensive lab draw, wellness exam, complete a health risk assessment (HRA) and be prescreened for diabetes, nicotine exposure and other health indicators.<\/p>\n<p>If the employee had diabetes, to enter the plan, he\/she had to follow the American Association of Diabetes recommendations for treating the condition. If the employee was a tobacco user, they had to complete a four course education program.<\/p>\n<p>After implementing the plan, our former benefits manager was in the elevator. An employee got on the elevator with him and got tears in her eyes. The employee said, \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough. By you forcing me to get my diabetes test, I now feel better than I have in 20 years. I am more productive and am better at work because, previously, my blood sugar was never under control.\u201d She was ecstatic to be healthy and productive \u2014 so much so that she grabbed and hugged him.<\/p>\n<p>The plan worked: 93 percent of our employees did everything asked of them, which is remarkable. Quite simply, it is unheard of for 93 percent of a population to undertake a health risk assessment. (The other seven percent were moved to the alternative higher cost option plan.)<\/p>\n<p>That said, we knew we had to continue to provide employees with the resources to help them make the healthy choices. So, we focused on on-site integrated person-to-person coaching and creating access to wellness resources, such as access to fitness equipment For instance, we use an addiction model to work with our employees who use tobacco. After implementing the plan, only 13 percent of our employees use tobacco \u2014 the average in Florida is 20 percent. We saw dramatic decreases in known tobacco users when we implemented the plan. Often, tobacco-users are looking for ways to quit and they credit the plan with giving them a reason. And we know they quit because it is verified by lab tests.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cWhen my wife and I were first required to qualify for the\u00a0<\/em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Good, Better, Best medical insurance, I could not understand\u00a0<\/em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">why we had to do the age based testing, but due to\u00a0<\/em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">personal experiences, today I do and I am so GRATEFUL.\u00a0<\/em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u2013Manatee Employee<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>\u201cI am currently taking the Pilates class on Tuesday\u00a0<\/em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">evening and really enjoying it.

For our plan to be successful, our outcomes needed to show that our plan drives employees to healthier habits and preventive care. We needed to catch and possibly prevent chronic conditions from ever developing.<\/p>\n<p>We can show success through several avenues. For one, we have seen an annual reduction in out of range blood lipids (cholesterol), which indicates we are catching things early and people are getting interventions when they need it. We have a diabetic educator on staff who also ensures that all members with diabetes obtain annual routine eye and foot exams along with regular HbA1C checks. Before we implemented this practice we had $500,000 in diabetes-related hospital fees. Since we created our plan, we spend $70,000 on diabetes-related hospital fees.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, when comparing 2010 to 2011, we achieved a negative trend: we spent approximately 4 percent less (over $2 million) in 2011 than in 2010. We achieved these results by a 9.5 percent reduction in chronic care spending, a 22 percent reduction in inpatient hospitalization and an 11 percent reduction in emergency room costs. These outcomes clearly show that the efforts back in 2006 of directing employees to preventative care and creating our onsite integrated health management and wellness team that guides employees to better health is showing a significant return on investment.<\/p>\n<p>Some people know what to do to get healthy and some people don\u2019t. Our plan helps those who know how to get healthy and those that don\u2019t \u2014 we see the plan as a nice blend of the carrot and the stick. We provide rewards but also requirements and it works.<\/p>\n<p>To assist employees in improving their health, we have an onsite, integrated health management and wellness team that works together to deal with the whole person. On-site we have Registered Nurses, Behavioral Health Specialists, Registered Dieticians, Clinical Pharmacists and Exercise Physiologists.<\/p>\n<p>Before coming to Manatee, I was a therapist in the community. If I had someone who was depressed and had diabetes, I didn\u2019t have a lot of options to get that person connected with resources to help with the diabetes. At Manatee, if we have a diabetic employee who is depressed, our dietician can connect him with the therapist who is on-site and part of the health management team \u2014 we can treat the physical and emotional needs at the same time and prevent further complications.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI wanted to comment on the Diabetic Program.

It has a long history of embracing and encouraging entrepreneurs, from wildcat oil prospectors to cutting-edge energy companies, and it regularly tops state rankings for its educated workforce, low taxes and relative lack of regulation.<\/p>\n<p>But in one key way, businesses in Texas are at a disadvantage. A report published earlier this year by the state comptroller found that obesity cost Texas businesses an extra $9.5 billion in 2009: more than $4 billion for health care, $5 billion for lost productivity and absenteeism and $321 million for disability.32, 33 The analysis estimated\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">that if current trends continue, the cost could more than triple by 2030.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThose are shocking numbers,\u201d said Susan Combs, the state comptroller. Obesity is a serious problem for Texas. Nearly 30 percent of the state\u2019s residents \u2014 more than eight million people \u2014 are obese, while another 37 percent\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">are overweight. Over the past 20 years, these rates have increased dramatically; in 1990, just over 12 percent of residents were obese.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Overall, Texas is the 12th most obese state in the country, according to a report released earlier this year by the Trust for America\u2019s Health.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Texas is not the only state where obesity hinders economic development. But for almost a decade, Combs has focused on the economic costs of the obesity crisis. As a result, more information exists about Texas\u2019 situation than for most states. First as agriculture commissioner and then as comptroller, she has worked to alert Texans to the health and economic risks of obesity.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Combs has focused on raising awareness in the private sector. \u201cThis is a huge issue for the financial security of our state,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know we have to get business involved. I don\u2019t know any other way to do it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Combs is not the only one worried about obesity\u2019s effect on the state\u2019s economy. \u201cIf obesity continues to rise, we will have a workforce that will not be as attractive as it could be to companies thinking of expanding or moving to Texas,\u201d said Eduardo Sanchez, a former state health commissioner who is now the Chief Medical Officer for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, as well as a member of the TFAH board of directors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cObese workers tend to have lower productivity because they have chronic disease, and they tend to lose time to disability. These are things that companies think about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The situation could get much worse. A 2009 report by the state demographer estimated that if current trends continue, 15 million Texas adults will be obese by 2040 \u2014 three times as many as now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFuture levels of obesity will be intolerable unless we make some changes,\u201d said demographer Karl Eschbach, who wrote the report. \u201cIf you look at this from a financial point of view, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Eschbach, who is now a professor at the University of Texas at Galveston, pointed especially to the growing cost of type 2 diabetes, a disease closely linked to obesity.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the possible projections, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at the state of Texas going from 10 percent of adults with diabetes to 25 percent with diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cDiabetes is a very expensive disease.\u201d As more in both the public and private sector have recognized the financial and medical costs of obesity, the state has become a leader in the fight to improve health. The state government, as well as some cities, counties and businesses, has taken\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">steps to help residents, students and workers increase their physical activity and eat more wisely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cTexas has been on the cutting edge in fighting obesity,\u201d said Carrie Kroll, chairwoman of the Partnership for a Healthy Texas, a coalition of more than 20 health and medical organizations trying to reduce the state\u2019s obesity rates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Toward Healthier Communities: San Antonio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many Texas cities and towns are working to help residents improve nutrition and increase activity.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, San Antonio embarked on an ambitious anti-obesity program, paid for by a $15.6 million federal grant.<\/p>\n<p>The program is funding the creation of three new farmers\u2019 markets around the city, and has started an effort to encourage people to choose healthy food when eating out. Health department dieticians have analyzed the menus of\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">more than 100 local restaurants and identified the healthiest items, which receive stickers that say \u201c\u00a1Por Vida!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some local fast food restaurants have even joined the program: for instance, at McDonalds, oatmeal and yogurt received the health department\u2019s approval.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, San Antonio has bought 150 bikes, which can be used for a few hours at a time by any\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">city resident who registers online and pays a $10 yearly fee. So far, the bikes, which are stored at 14 kiosks around the city, are averaging 100 checkouts a day. And the city is crafting Complete Streets regulations, which would require any new projects to include consideration of walkers and bicyclists.41<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The program has installed playgrounds and exercise equipment in 26 parks around the city, as well as outside several city libraries. To encourage activity, the parks department is offering free exercise classes in various parks: yoga, tai chi, as well as more intensive \u201cboot camp\u201d sessions. Since last year, more than 4,000 people have taken the classes.<\/p>\n<p>The initiative has also focused on childhood obesity, which is a major problem for San Antonio: nearly one in three of the city\u2019s public school students have an unhealthy weight.<\/p>\n<p>Combs and others emphasize that childhood obesity is also an economic problem. \u201cThe cost of childhood obesity is not as well appreciated by policymakers, and by the private sector, as it ought to be,\u201d said Sanchez.<\/p>\n<p>A national study published last year found that for one large corporation, average health insurance costs for an obese child were more than $1,200 higher than for a healthy-weight child. For a child with type 2 diabetes, costs were more than $9,000 higher annually. And of course, obese children are more likely to become obese adults, who spend an average of more than $1,400 extra on health care annually compared to healthy-weight adults.<\/p>\n<p>To help its children lose weight and stay healthy, San Antonio is installing salad bars in 100 schools, and it has bought exercise equipment for 365 schools, which together serve 275,000 students. The material includes hundreds of balance balls, hula hoops and jump ropes, as well as thousands of orange plastic cones for relay races and obstacle courses.<\/p>\n<p>Some evidence indicates that in San Antonio (as in most places), those with lower incomes tend to have higher obesity rates. To help deal with this, the health department will give away 1,000 bikes to lower-income residents.<\/p>\n<p>The bikes are free, but recipients must first show their commitment by taking classes on bike safety and bike\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">maintenance. The city has also built five walking trails in public housing projects around the city. To publicize all of this work, San Antonio will soon roll out an integrated media campaign, whose slogan is \u201cFind Your Balance.\u201d It will include TV, radio and print ads, a website and social media.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>San Antonio is not the only place in the state trying to lose weight. Over the past decade, El Paso has undertaken several anti-obesity efforts, much of it funded by the Paso Del Norte Foundation, a local non-profit group. The group is funding a community walking program, cooking classes and food labeling in supermarkets and restaurants, so shoppers and diners can more easily identify healthy and unhealthy foods.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employers: Helping Workers Get Healthy, Lowering Insurance Costs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Across the state, businesses are also realizing how obesity can significantly increase health care costs and reduce productivity. Some are attacking the problem by setting up wellness programs that help workers better control their weight. \u201cCorporations are starting to realize that this is costing them a lot of money,\u201d said University of Texas<\/p>\n<p>epidemiologist Steve Kelder, who has studied the state\u2019s obesity problem for more than a decade. For instance, the regional supermarket chain HEB, which is based in San Antonio, has also developed a successful wellness program. \u201cWe wanted to reduce health care costs and get people to take more responsibility for their health,\u201d said Kate Rogers, who oversees the company\u2019s program. More than 700 workers serve as \u201cwellness champions,\u201d encouraging\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">colleagues to join and answering their questions. Over the past eight years, the program has helped HEB keep health care cost increases at less than half of the national average.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Last year, the company inaugurated its \u201cSlimdown Showdown\u201d: 15 employees, one from each region, competed to see who could lose the most weight. The winner received $10,000. Rogers said the contest helped energize other<\/p>\n<p>employees who want to improve their health. In addition, each of the 15 regions sponsors at least one 5k community race<\/p>\n<p>HEB is also encouraging kids to be more active. It will award 12 schools $15,000 each to improve their health and nutrition education programs. The contest is open to any school in Texas within 60 miles of an HEB store.<\/p>\n<p>Some towns and cities in the state are also trying to cut costs through wellness programs. Hurst, a suburb of Fort Worth, developed a comprehensive wellness program for employees, retirees and their families.58 Started six years ago, it encourages participation with bonuses, gifts and extra vacation time. For the last two years, the program<\/p>\n<p>has had a weight loss contest, and more than a third of all city workers have taken part. Due largely to the wellness program, the city\u2019s health insurance premiums have risen little over the past five years, much less than would be expected.<\/p>\n<p>And between 2007 and 2009, absenteeism among Hurst workers fell by nearly 40 percent.59 The city also offers a less extensive web-based wellness program to all of its 36,000 residents. That program, Healthy Hurst, helps participants with exercise plans, nutrition information, food logs and a program to track progress.60<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health in Schools: Investing in the State\u2019s Future<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Across the state, childhood obesity is a major problem: one in five Texas children is obese, higher than the national average.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past decade, the state government has made several moves to reduce the problem. In 2001, it required all elementary schools to provide 135 minutes of physical education per week.62 A large percentage of schools, especially elementary schools, have adopted these guidelines.63 Two years ago, the legislature passed regulations\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">requiring schools to devote at least half of every PE class to physical activity.64 Previously many schools used PE as study hall or supervised free time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In 2003, the state department of agriculture limited access to unhealthy competitive foods \u2014 products sold at on campus that are not part of the school meal program.65 Texas was one of the first states to regulate competitive foods.<\/p>\n<p>Many state elementary and middle schools have also adopted the Coordinated Approach To Child Health (CATCH), a program to help students control weight and improve health.<\/p>\n<p>CATCH includes a range of features, such as classroom education about nutrition and physical activity, training for teachers and expert advice for cafeteria workers on how to make school food healthier. The program was developed two decades ago by researchers at four universities, including the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Studies have shown that CATCH can reduce the fat content of school lunches, increase physical activity during PE classes and improve students\u2019 eating and exercise habits.<\/p>\n<p>An independent study of CATCH in the El Paso school district found a seven percent decrease in obesity rates among fourth graders. \u201cThere were dramatic reductions in rates of obesity and overweight,\u201d said Kelder, one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThis is a good example of what a community can do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>CATCH has been implemented in schools across the country, but it has been used most widely in Texas.70 Kelder, who is one of the program\u2019s original developers, estimates that half of the state\u2019s elementary schools have received\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">CATCH training, as have 30 to 40 percent of middle schools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Research suggests that CATCH is a good investment. A 2007 study found that the program was the most cost-effective way to prevent obesity among youth. According to the study, the program costs $900 for every healthy year it adds to an obese child\u2019s life. This is far below the cut-off point of $30,000 a year that the study used to determine cost-effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007, Texas instituted a comprehensive evaluation of students\u2019 physical fitness levels. Known as the Fitnessgram, the analysis consists of six tests, which measure body composition, aerobic capacity, strength, endurance and flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>During the 2009-2010 school year, the state tested nearly three million students. Only 31 percent of third-grade boys and 37 percent of third-grade girls could pass all of the tests. For older students, the results got progressively worse.<\/p>\n<p>For seventh graders, 28 percent of girls and 21 percent of boys passed every test. Less than ten percent of high school seniors of either gender passed. But the situation may be improving. In 2007, at Combs\u2019 urging, the legislature created Texas Fitness Now, which provides state middle schools with grants to improve physical and nutrition education programs.74 So far the state education agency has given $27 million to more than 2,100 schools.<\/p>\n<p>Most schools have used the grants to train teachers and buy physical education equipment. An evaluation of the program found that participating schools significantly improved the percentage of students who passed their Fitnessgram tests.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers have correlated the Fitnessgram results with other data from school districts, and found links between physical fitness and improved academic performance, school attendance and good behavior.75, 76<\/p>\n<p>Combs has more plans for the Fitnessgram data. Her office is now integrating the results with information about communities\u2019 obesity rates along with the number of parks and grocery stores. She plans to share the results with communities so that officials, parents and others will have a better sense of how these environmental<\/p>\n<p>factors may affect health and weight.<\/p>\n<p>Combs and other experts realize that Texas faces years of hard work. The obesity crisis has many causes, and reversing it will not be easy. The state faces significant obstacles, including potential state and local budget cuts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a 20- to 30-year process,\u201d said Kelder, the University of Texas epidemiologist. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect dramatic results quickly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>USAA TAKES WELLNESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL<\/p>\n<p>Peter Wald is willing to try almost anything to help his company\u2019s workers get healthy. As the director of USAA\u2019s wellness program, he has instituted discounted salads, bonuses for going to the gym, even mileage signs in long hallways.<\/p>\n<p>His work seems to be paying off. Since starting the program in 2002, the San Antonio-based financial services company has reined in health costs. \u00a0And 85 percent of the company\u2019s 22,000 workers have joined.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s program has three goals: to improve health, lower company health costs and improve productivity. Reducing and controlling obesity is a key focus. USAA researchers found that obesity is behind a significant amount of the company\u2019s health care spending. \u201cHealth care is always a big chunk of your labor costs,\u201d Wald said. \u201cWith obesity, health care costs have the potential to really go up.&#8221;<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>USAA offers employees a variety of inducements to get healthy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Employees pay $300 a year to use company fitness centers, which are in almost every company building. But workers who go once a week for a year get 25 percent off; those who go twice a week get half off; those who go three or more times a week get 75 percent off.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">USAA has built running and walking trails and paths at many of its campuses, and painted mileage markers in company hallways to encourage indoor walking. In company cafeterias, healthy food is at eye level, while food that\u2019s bad for you is lower down \u2014 the opposite approach taken by many supermarkets. Healthy items have a prominent green tag.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">In 2008, the program added weight loss and other health incentives; employees who meet requirements can earn up to $550 a year. USAA also offers lower health insurance premiums for improving health; single workers can save up to $300, while those with dependents can save as much as $950.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">In company cafeterias, pricing encourages workers to buy healthy food, water costs $1.25, while soda is $1.50; a turkey burger costs slightly less than a beef burger; and a veggie burger costs less than a turkey burger. \u201cWe keep track of consumption,\u201d Wald said. \u201cIt works.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The incentives have contributed to increased weight loss, improved health measurements and decreased costs. In 2009, the company\u2019s average employee BMI fell for the first time in five years. Over the past five years, its health insurance costs rose just two percent a year, far below the national average.80<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">In recent years, USAA\u2019s annual health care costs have increased by just two percent a year, a quarter of the national average. On top of that, the average employee BMI has gone down slightly for two years in a row.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper to keep people healthy than it is to take care of them when they\u2019re sick,\u201d said Wald. \u201cThe way for us to control costs is to keep people healthy. We\u2019re doing a full court press.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the example <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Texas.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/texas-recognizes-the-costs-of-excess-weight-tries-to-do-something-about-it","date":"2013-02-22T19:17:57","modified":"2015-06-02T18:09:54","format":"standard","slug":"texas-recognizes-the-costs-of-excess-weight-tries-to-do-something-about-it","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4919","excerpt":"<p>Texas has a reputation as a pro-business state.

Philip Huang, MD, MPH, Medical Director\/Health Authority at City of Austin<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Travis County, tobacco is the number one preventable cause of death; it is estimated that 11 people die each week in Travis County from tobacco-related disease. Tobacco kills more than AIDS, crack, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fires, car accidents, suicides and murder combined. To prevent the chronic and deadly conditions that come from tobacco use, Travis County and the City of Austin focused on policies and programs that would shift the population and environment away from tobacco use and ensure long-term sustainability and positive gains.<\/p>\n<p>Since the city already had a strong clean indoor air ordinance, we looked to go beyond smoke-free and address tobacco-free campuses and outdoor areas. To obtain community involvement, we partnered with a large coalition that included members from the business community, healthcare providers, local foundations, schools and universities, local non profits, and city and county agencies.<\/p>\n<p>From a clinical standpoint, we worked with the Integrated Care Collaboration, a coalition of local indigent care providers including the Federally Qualified Health Centers. These efforts modified electronic health records to ensure every patient was assessed for tobacco use and offered cessation services at every visit. We also challenged these groups to adopt 100 percent tobacco-free campus policies \u2014 not just smoking, but chewing tobacco and other forms as well. We found that there was very little perceived difference between tobacco-free and smoke-free, so it\u2019s far easier to start with the more encompassing tobacco-free initiatives. Collaborators on this project include Seton Family of Hospitals, Lone Star Circle of Care, Central Health (Travis County Healthcare District), CommUnity Care, El Buen Samaritano and Peoples Community Clinic.<\/p>\n<p>One of our own employees was dramatically impacted by the Seton Family of Hospitals smoke-free campus policy when she was caring for her husband at Seton after he was diagnosed with lung cancer.<\/p>\n<p>After over 40 years of smoking, she finally quit because of the inconvenience of having to walk across the street to smoke. She found that she saved thousands of dollars and was able to give up smoking after just two weeks of trying.<\/p>\n<p>Austin\/Travis County Integral Care (ATCIC), the local mental health and substance abuse authority, was one of the first in our community to adopt a tobacco-free campus policy. Data shows that persons with serious mental illness are two to four times more likely to develop a nicotine addiction, consume nearly half of the cigarettes sold in the United States, and have a 25-year shorter life expectancy than the rest of the general population.<\/p>\n<p>ATCIC heard from their clients that they really didn\u2019t want to be smoking; they just smoked because everyone else was and they were bored. The policy changed the environment: cigarettes were once seen as rewards for positive behaviors, but now the entire center is tobacco-free, healthier and even more successful in dealing with all of their clients\u2019 addictions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, there is support for tobacco-free policies in worksites and universities. The Mayor\u2019s Fitness Council has a certification program that rewards employers that promote healthy behaviors, including physical activity, good nutrition and tobacco-free policies.<\/p>\n<p>After tobacco-free policies were implemented at participating companies, some of the most vocal employees who had initially been opposed to the tobacco-free policies sent thank you e-mails detailing how they quit smoking because of the policies and how it changed their lives. At Dell Computer, smoking rates went from 13 percent to three percent \u2014 very few interventions can have that kind of impact on behavior. Quite simply, going tobacco-free at workplaces promotes healthy behaviors and can prevent health consequences and save healthcare dollars down the line.<\/p>\n<p>As we were working to limit outdoor tobacco use, we also began to look at our parks. Texas has been in extreme drought, and in September, 2011, we had the most catastrophic fire in Texas history just outside of Austin in Bastrop. Partnering with the Parks and Recreation Department, we were able to get the media to warn people about tobacco-use in parks and the potential for setting fires. Because of a burn ban in place, for the first time ever, the Austin City Limits Music Festival was officially smoke-free. Then, in December 2011, the Austin City Council passed a smoke-free park ordinance. Through all our initiatives, we\u2019ve found that if you give communities and leaders resources and information, they can make impactful changes and prevent illness down the road.<\/p>\n<p>Our work is by no means complete, we still need tobacco free policies for multi-unit housing and restaurant and bar patios, but we know our community is an engaged and active participant in this movement.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of this story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2012InvstgAmrcsHlthAustin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/travis-county-and-austin-city-limit-tobacco-use","date":"2013-02-22T19:06:43","modified":"2015-06-02T17:50:42","format":"standard","slug":"travis-county-and-austin-city-limit-tobacco-use","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4917","excerpt":"<p>By Philip Huang, MD, MPH, Medical Director\/Health Authority at City of Austin &nbsp; In Travis County, tobacco is the number one preventable cause of death; it is estimated that 11 people die each week in Travis County from tobacco-related disease.

But these days, the industry that really makes the city move is health care. More than 20 large health care companies are based there, including the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), one of the country\u2019s largest hospital chains.<\/p>\n<p>Health care revenues account for more than $29 billion a year, a fifth of the city\u2019s total economy. But when it comes to its own health, Nashville is a beat behind. Nearly 28 percent of its adults are obese, and another 36 percent are overweight.<\/p>\n<p>This disconnect has alarmed city officials, health advocates and business leaders \u2014 not only because obesity and its related ills are consigning tens of thousands of the city\u2019s citizens to unnecessary illness or disability. They also realize that poor health is expensive, and can harm economic development, both in the short and long term.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf your company has a lot of people with chronic disease, you\u2019re spending a lot of money,\u201d said William Paul, the city\u2019s health commissioner. \u201cIf you can prevent those diseases from happening, you can save a significant amount.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, he said, a healthy population can be a major draw for companies looking to relocate or expand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNashville wants to attract new business,\u201d said Paul. \u201cIf we\u2019re known as a healthy city, that becomes a positive thing for economic development. If we\u2019re known as a city that thinks about the health of our workforce, that will be a big plus for companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To improve Nashville\u2019s long-term prognosis, the city government, along with businesses and nonprofit groups, have undertaken an ambitious effort to increase residents\u2019 physical activity and improve their eating habits. Combining money from the city budget with more than $7 million in federal funds, Nashville is adding sidewalks and bike lanes, making healthy food more widely available and encouraging citizens to get more active.<\/p>\n<p>While the central goal is improving Nashville\u2019s health, saving money is also crucial, said Alisa Haushalter, a nurse with the health department who is project director for the program. \u201cEverything we do takes economic impact into account,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the old adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Encouraging Exercise and Better Nutrition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>City officials are focusing on changing systemic policies rather than just introducing specific, time-limited programs. For instance, instead of starting an exercise program that will end when funding runs out, the city passed a Complete Streets law, which encourages street improvement projects to include sidewalks and bike lanes.86 The goal is to change the overall environment in which people live, work and play, making it easier to exercise\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">and eat healthy foods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This year, Nashville also allocated $30 million for parks and greenways, a 30 percent increase from the year before. Nashville is planning to build 25 miles of new walking trails, and has allotted $3 million for 19 miles of new bike paths and $12.5 million to build or improve 19 miles of sidewalks.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the city helped set up 80 urban vegetable gardens around the city, to encourage both exercise \u2014 gardening burns calories \u2014and healthy eating. Many of the gardens pair teens with senior citizens as a way to create social bonds that might not occur otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>The health department also bought 126 bikes, which will be stored around the city on racks near bike paths and greenways. The bikes can be used by any city resident for a few hours at a time, at no cost. To ensure that the bikes are not stolen, those who want to use them must first register online. In addition, the parks department is improving signs and markings along many city trails and bike paths.<\/p>\n<p>This summer, to make sure that residents know about this work, and to encourage them to change how they live, the city rolled out \u201cNashvitality,\u201d a media campaign with radio and TV ads, as well as a web site.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the health department is working to improve food in neighborhoods that have little access to healthy food. In these areas, many residents end up shopping at convenience stores, which typically sell few nutritious products.<\/p>\n<p>In partnership with Community Food Advocates, another local non-profit, Nashville is helping 29 of these stores improve what they offer. The city provides coolers to each store and offers advice on how to choose, stock and market fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as other items such as whole wheat bread.90 \u201cBefore, all you could buy in these stores was chips, candy and beer,\u201d said David Campbell, one of the project\u2019s coordinators at the city health department. \u201cThere was hardly any fresh fruit or vegetables.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nashville\u2019s mayor, Karl Dean, has taken a leading role in improving the city\u2019s health. Earlier this year, he started \u201cWalk 100 Miles with the Mayor,\u201d a program that challenged residents to walk that distance over the course of several months. This spring and summer, he took part in 28 public walks around the city, all betweentwo and 10 miles. So far, more than 4,000 residents have signed up; together, they have walked more than 100,000 miles.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a difficult problem, but obesity comes down to issues we can control \u2014 what we eat and how much we exercise,\u201d Dean said. He takes the message personally: he lifts weights almost every other day, and does cardiovascular exercise several times a week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Businesses on Board<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nashville is also focusing on the workplace. Health department officials, along with the Chamber of Commerce, are talking to 10 of the city\u2019s largest companies and institutions, including Vanderbilt University and HCA, which together employ tens of thousands of residents, about how to encourage physical activity and smarter eating.<\/p>\n<p>Among the options being discussed: increasing nutritious options in vending machines; requiring water and healthy food at meetings; subsidizing gym memberships and mass transit passes; allowing employees to exercise during work time; and installing bike racks on company grounds.<\/p>\n<p>Vanderbilt has already developed an extensive wellness program for the 43,000 participants in its health plan (25,000 employees and 18,000 family members). Seven years ago, the institution created \u201cGo For The Gold,\u201d a program that pays people up to $360 a year if they provide information about their health and lifestyle and receive\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">instruction in how to get healthier. Almost 90 percent of those in the school\u2019s health plan participated in at least part of the program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In 2008, the program received the prestigious C. Everett Koop National Health Award.95 The university is also revamping its cafeterias, subsidizing some nutritious foods and prominently displaying healthier choices. In one building, they replaced a McDonalds with an Au Bon Pain.96 Vanderbilt has also developed a pilot program designed to help those most at risk. It started 30 employees, all recently diagnosed with diabetes, on an intensive exercise and nutrition program. All participants improved their cholesterol and blood sugar measurements, and nearly a quarter were able to stop taking all their medications. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen dramatic changes,\u201d said Dexter Shurney, MD, who helps direct Vanderbilt\u2019s wellness program. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty excited about this.\u201d97 He is now working to expand the program.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe question,\u201d he said, \u201cis how to scale this up for 43,000 people. But if we can get more of our population to do these intensive lifestyle programs, we can see substantial savings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>HCA is also trying to cut costs by improving workers\u2019 health. This year, the company, which insures 148,000 employees and 72,000 dependents around the country, began offering a $250 health care spending credit to those who complete an online health survey and assessment. So far 65 percent of workers have taken part. About 15,000 were found to have increased risk of a chronic disease; they were advised to see a doctor and to visit a company website with disease information.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also testing a pilot program for people with pre-diabetes or diabetes. Once a month, about 350 workers receive individual coaching from a certified diabetes educator on how to reduce risks through exercise, healthy eating and medication. HCA researchers found that compared to a control group, those who were coached had a nearly 50 percent drop in emergency room visits, and a five percent drop in overall health care costs. None of the pre-diabetics who were coached became fully diabetic, and 57 percent stopped being pre-diabetic altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Yonnie Chesley, who is in charge of HCA\u2019s wellness efforts, said the pilot program will soon expand to 1,000 people. If that proves successful, the initiative will go company-wide next year; overall, the company has about 17,000 pre-diabetic or diabetic employees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Improving Children\u2019s Lives \u2014 and Saving Money<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The city is also investing in ways to improve the health of the city\u2019s future workforce, with efforts aimed at children and schools.<\/p>\n<p>Improving the health of Nashville\u2019s children will do more than reduce costs in decades to come; it will also help cut current costs. Childhood obesity is expensive: a recent study calculated that in the United States, each obese child costs the health care system nearly $300 a year more than a healthy weight child. The researchers calculated that reducing the rate of childhood obesity by just one percentage point would save at least $1.4 billion annually.<\/p>\n<p>And because obese adults tend to use even more health care resources, helping obese children lose weight before they grow up will eventually save even more money. \u201cHelping them learn healthy habits will really help down the road,\u201d said Haushalter, the city\u2019s obesity program director.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long-term economic solution.\u201d Last year, the Nashville school district lowered sugar levels in flavored milk, a reduction of 22 calories per carton. Because of the change, Nashville\u2019s 77,000 public school students will ingest 50,000 fewer pounds of sugar a year. In conjunction with a local non-profit, the district is also working to improve the nutrition of products sold in school vending machines.<\/p>\n<p>More than 40 schools have set up vegetable gardens, which are tended primarily by students. This summer, 20 of the district\u2019s cafeteria managers, who together are responsible for food at more than 140 schools, received training on improving nutrition. Many of these schools are adding salad bars, and most are increasing the number of dishes that are prepared from scratch or with fresh fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n<p>Other changes are on the way too. \u201cNashville is like most places,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cThe food you eat in a school is generally not very healthy \u2014 tater tots, hot dogs, french fries. We want to move to salads, fresh fruit and vegetables.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the city is targeting children who aren\u2019t yet old enough for school. The health department is working with eight Head Start programs, which together have nearly 2,000 students, to incorporate physical activity into learning and teach children about good nutrition.<\/p>\n<p>Paul, the health commissioner, is confident that the combination of Nashvitality and private sector efforts will yield results. \u201cIf we can have even a small effect on health care costs,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a big payoff, for a relatively small investment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Haushalter agrees, but preaches patience. \u201cWe are in an epidemic that has occurred over several decades,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be very diligent. This will take many years to change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the example <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Nashville.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/nashvilles-new-tune-inevsting-in-health","date":"2013-02-22T19:01:43","modified":"2015-06-02T17:42:37","format":"standard","slug":"nashvilles-new-tune-inevsting-in-health","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4914","excerpt":"<p>Nashville is known as the home of country music.

human resources manager for Explorer Pipeline in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Michelle Griffith oversees the company\u2019s wellness program, which includes an incentive program for employees who exercise, seminars, a health fair and an email newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>Griffith, a fitness buff, is an enthusiastic participant in the program herself. Among other activities, she runs several times a week during lunch with a group of Explorer employees.<\/p>\n<p>Griffith takes pride in her company\u2019s program. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people quit smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people lose weight, and we\u2019ve had people start exercising more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company owns and runs a pipeline that transports crude oil, jet fuel, diesel fuel and other petroleum products from Port Arthur, Texas to Indiana. Nearly 1,900 miles long, the pipeline handles about 200 million barrels a year. Half of the company\u2019s 200 employees work in Tulsa, while the other half work at seven locations spread along the length of the pipeline. These workers run the gamut, from accountants to secretaries to pipeline repair experts.<\/p>\n<p>Although it has a dispersed workforce, the company feels a strong loyalty to its employees. \u201cSince we\u2019re a small company, we\u2019re close-knit,\u201d said Griffith. \u201cWe\u2019re like a family. And we want to take care of our family.\u201d Explorer\u2019s wellness program was started in 2007 by former CEO Tim Felt. A former U.S. Army captain who graduated from West Point, Felt believes strongly in the value of wellness and the importance of healthy living.<\/p>\n<p>Felt said that the wellness program not only helps employees\u2019 health, but can also improve the bottom line. \u201cThe company is paying a significant amount of employee health care costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means I\u2019ve got a vested interest in keeping workers healthy.<\/p>\n<p>So there\u2019s a financial interest \u2014 and it\u2019s just the right thing to do.\u201d There is evidence to support him: in a 2010 review of studies on wellness, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that for every dollar a company spends on wellness programs, it saves about $3.27 in medical costs and about $2.73 on absentee costs.<\/p>\n<p>Felt, who is now the CEO at Colonial Pipeline outside Atlanta, said that the idea for the program first occurred to him at a company meeting at which donuts were the featured snack. Afterwards, one overweight employee came up to Felt and said it was hard to lose weight in an environment in which high-calorie foods were the only choice. \u201cFrom that point on,\u201d Felt said, \u201cI decided that if the company was paying for the food, there was going to be a healthy alternative.\u201d At future meetings, fruit and water were always part of the offerings. Felt said the new policy made a difference. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people will eat the fruit or drink the water, if you make it available,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Felt, who regularly bikes, lifts weights and works on an elliptical trainer, then expanded Explorer\u2019s program beyond serving healthier food at meetings. A committee of eight employees began developing ideas, and in 2008, Explorer rolled out its program. The effort includes an incentive program that pays employees $30 per quarter if they reach certain health-related targets, such as taking an annual physical, participating in a wellness seminar, running in road races, and taking certain vitamins, as well as prescribed medicines. Every week, Griffith sends employees a weekly email that includes articles on wellness and health recipes.<\/p>\n<p>In the past two years, Griffith has added new features to Explorer\u2019s effort. Every month, the company holds seminars on a range of health- and wellness-related topics. Recent seminars have focused on strategies to improve diet and nutrition, and stress management. The meetings take place at the Tulsa headquarters; to ensure that workers in other locations don\u2019t miss out, the seminars are videotaped and webcast.<\/p>\n<p>Explorer also puts on an annual health fair. It offers flu shots, and screenings for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and other ailments. In 2011, Griffith helped start a lunchtime walking and running program. A few times a week, groups of employees in the Tulsa office walk or run together for between 30 minutes and an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to break up the day,\u201d said Griffith.<\/p>\n<p>The program also reimburses employees up to $50 a month for their health club membership. To get the discount, workers must go to the club at least eight times a month.<\/p>\n<p>So far, she said, about one-quarter of the company\u2019s workers are participating in at least some part of the voluntary wellness program.<\/p>\n<p>To entice employees to participate, the program includes regular health challenges. Every three months, Explorer encourages workers to improve on a specific aspect of wellness: eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, or exercising for at least 30 minutes at least five times a week.<\/p>\n<p>A significant percentage of the company\u2019s employees work outside; these workers have somewhat different health concerns than do more sedentary office workers. In the summer of 2011, for instance, the company focused on encouraging employees to drink enough water every day \u2014 something that is especially important for those working outside in the heat.<\/p>\n<p>Griffith said that it is difficult to gauge how much money the wellness program has saved the company. But she notes that the company\u2019s health insurance costs have not risen over the past few years. The overall number of health insurance claims filed by employees has also dropped.<\/p>\n<p>Felt, the company\u2019s former CEO, agrees that calculating savings from wellness programs is tricky. But he is confident that the programs can have a positive influence on employees \u2014 so confident that he has started a wellness program at his new company too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is about helping employees to go in the right direction in terms of their health,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of this example <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Explorer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/explorer-pipeline","date":"2013-02-22T18:35:54","modified":"2013-02-27T14:47:35","format":"standard","slug":"explorer-pipeline","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4904","excerpt":"<p>As human resources manager for Explorer Pipeline in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Michelle Griffith oversees the company\u2019s wellness program, which includes an incentive program for employees who exercise, seminars, a health fair and an email newsletter.

Department of Transportation<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) convened a meeting of the state Departments of Transportation (NCDOT), Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR), and Commerce to discuss the possibility of the four agencies working together on common goals where public health, the natural environment, economic prosperity, and the built environment (e.g.,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">greenways, bike ways, roads, parks) intersect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The result of this conversation was the development of the Healthy Environments Collaborative (HEC), an interagency partnership whose mission is to integrate and align departmental efforts to improve the health of North Carolina\u2019s people, economy and environments.<\/p>\n<p>When the HEC began meeting, partners focused on gaining an increased understanding of the work of each agency and where there were potential opportunities to work together to achieve common goals.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next couple of years, the HEC created a vision, mission and a strategic plan, and gained support from the Secretaries of the four state departments. In 2009, NCDHHS received Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW) funding, through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA), to<\/p>\n<p>create more physical activity opportunities for North Carolinians by creating environments that support physical activity. With guidance from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Gillings School of Global Public Health, the HEC analyzed and prioritized the importance and feasibility of different activities that would support physical activity environments across the state.<\/p>\n<p>They also identified opportunities where they, as state agencies, could help remove obstacles that local governments face in their efforts to create physical activity environments.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently the HEC held a strategic planning session and identified three key areas where all four departments could work together for mutual benefit: data, comprehensive planning and research. These key areas support current initiatives of all four agencies and provide an opportunity to undertake common efforts that align with the work that all agencies are already undertaking, which increases efficiency and use of resources. In addition to the collaborative efforts of the HEC, each agency now better understands and can support the efforts of other agencies. For example, NCDHHS was awarded Community Transformation Grant funding and is working very closely with NCDOT, NCDENR and Commerce to increase the number of communities across North Carolina that include health considerations in their comprehensive plans. NCDOT has included a health component in the development of its comprehensive<\/p>\n<p>Statewide Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan and is also working closely with NCDENR and Commerce to better connect biking and walking facilities to existing trails and provide active transportation options that enhance economic prosperity and promote a healthier workforce within the state.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce has added attributes, such as greenways, bike trails, and other recreational venues to its \u201cBuildings and Sites\u201d website as an offering to local communities to further showcase available commercial buildings and industrial sites as \u201chealthy worksites.\u201d The allowance of this information informs prospective relocating businesses that there is access to parks and recreation, greenways, pedestrian walkways, etc., that is readily available to their employees. NCDENR and NCDOT have partnered to work through environmental design issues that, in the past, have been problematic for greenway construction.<\/p>\n<p>The HEC has led to the identification of opportunities where four state departments can work together and achieve mutual goals \u2014 even with different organizational missions. The agencies have learned that the state will not realize significant positive changes in public health unless they look at the built environment in concert with efforts on prevention and the treatment of chronic disease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health and Transportation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The NCDOTs mission is to connect people and places safely and efficiently with accountability and environmental sensitivity and to enhance the economy, health and well-being of North Carolina.<\/p>\n<p>NCDOT recognizes that the opportunity to increase physical activity, and therefore improve public health, lies in the department\u2019s concept of \u201cactive\u201d or \u201chealthy\u201d transportation. It is reported that people who live walking distance to trails, paths or stores report higher amounts of walking than those who do not. NCDOT recognizes that active transportation is important to creating livable, vibrant and healthy communities and is working to affect policy and organizational change through several collaborative efforts.<\/p>\n<p>One such collaborative effort, currently underway, is the development of the Statewide Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan. The plan will integrate public health considerations; demonstrate how active transportation contributes to a healthier workforce that can increase worker productivity and enhance North Carolina\u2019s recruitment\/retention of businesses; and describe how biking and walking facilities can be co-located to provide enhanced access to conservation and green open space, as well as minimize overall impacts to the environment.<\/p>\n<p>With regard to the transportation-related strategies, NCDOT recognizes that it will also have to be strategic to ensure the state is getting the best bang for the buck. For example, sidewalks, bike lanes and greenways cannot be put everywhere as funding is limited. This means that as NCDOT, state agency partners and local governments work together, they must understand what the community\u2019s needs are with regard to mobility, while also considering where facilities could have the most potential to create increased choices for physical activity for the most at-risk populations.<\/p>\n<p>There has never been a comprehensive statewide bicycle and walking plan, anywhere in the nation, as wide reaching as one NCDOT is creating. As part of the plan\u2019s development, NCDOT is performing a Health Impact Assessment to articulate the benefits of integrating bicycling and walking intentionally into transportation policies and practices. The project, widely supported and funded by the Federal Highway Administration, Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC Foundation, Commerce, NCDENR, NCDHHS and others, has become a unique collaboration. When completed, the plan will reflect the linkages of active transportation, the economy, natural environment and public health. Going forward it will also help drive policy and decision making around bike and pedestrian transportation outcomes in local communities.<\/p>\n<p>The Statewide Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan is one example of how NCDOT is collaborating with its partners to create the opportunity for improved health outcomes throughout North Carolina communities. North Carolina agencies will continue to engage others and work together toward common goals for healthy communities in order to more efficiently leverage resources and achieve goals related to mobility, public health, commerce, and environment and natural resources.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Healthy Communities and a Healthy Economy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Commerce has a web-based tool on its Access NC website containing information that allows prospective business and industry clients to search for specific attributes of buildings and sites available within the state. Going one step further, Commerce recently added health and quality of life attributes that can now promote the availability of sites with access to parks and recreation, greenways, pedestrian walkways, etc. Commerce believes that illustrating health and recreational access can be a major selling point in attracting and retaining businesses and talent.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2013HealthierAmericaXrpt14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/north-carolina-transportation-commerce-and-environment-are-integral-in-building-healthy-communities","date":"2013-02-22T17:38:22","modified":"2015-06-02T17:50:47","format":"standard","slug":"north-carolina-transportation-commerce-and-environment-are-integral-in-building-healthy-communities","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4894","excerpt":"<p>By Ruth Petersen MD, MPH, Section Chief, Chronic Disease and Injury Section, N.C.

He, along with the Health Commissioner at the time, Dr. Thomas Frieden, made tobacco cessation and the prevention of tobacco-related illnesses<\/p>\n<p>and chronic conditions their number one priority for the health department.<\/p>\n<p>To truly prevent tobacco-related illnesses and conditions, we knew we had to help large numbers of people and implement scientifically- proven, population-based interventions.<\/p>\n<p>We developed a five-point plan:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Price increases: <\/strong>studies have shown taxes to be the most effective way of reducing smoking prevalence;<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Legislation and policies that promote smoke free air: <\/strong>New York City was one of the first in the country to pass a comprehensive smoke-free law that included all workplaces including bars and restaurants;<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Cessation: <\/strong>make cessation medications and services as available as possible to every New Yorker who wants them;<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Mass public education campaigns: <\/strong>we learned a lot from what California, Massachusetts and Australia had done with media, most notably graphic depictions of the health consequences of smoking in the hopes of encouraging people to prevent developing these conditions; and<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Research and evaluation: <\/strong>Both Dr. Frieden and our current commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, want to understand the impact of our work and ensure the interventions we implemented curb tobacco prevalence and prevent tobacco-related illnesses.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, the most unique aspect of our plan was the public education campaign. We found that developing and disseminating educational campaigns that depict the harsh realities of the consequences of smoking (both on the smoker and those who live with and care for the smoker) helps people take the initial step toward quitting.<\/p>\n<p>In my personal life, friends and new acquaintances routinely ask about the campaign featuring Marie. Marie has Buerger\u2019s Disease, which affects those with a history of heavy smoking or chewing tobacco. As a result, Marie has had most of her fingers, a leg and a foot amputated.<\/p>\n<p>Through these ads, Marie has become a local celebrity \u2014 people recognize her and often tell her they quit smoking because of her. Marie shows that it\u2019s never too late to quit. When we showed her ads, 30,000 New Yorkers called our quit line in 16 days.<\/p>\n<p>In New York City, we have seen a great decline in tobacco prevalence. In 2002, prevalence was at 21.5 percent, and it is now 14 percent. And, youth smoking is lower than ever, at about 7 percent. As we\u2019ve seen these successes, other cities and communities have asked for our help and best practices. We sometimes find that communities are reluctant to tell the hard truth of smoking related illness and would\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">prefer more aspirational, feel good messages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I suggest jurisdictions really investigate the data on the effectiveness in New York City and Australia on the ads \u2014 they work.<\/p>\n<p>Many of New York City\u2019s ads have been shown all over the world; when ads are effective from New York City to the Ukraine to India, there\u2019s something there. People don\u2019t want to get sick, suffer, die and devastate their families; and communities want to prevent illnesses.<\/p>\n<p>While you might get calls from the community complaining when airing these campaigns, the reality is that smoking causes ugly terrible things; these ads tell the truth. We\u2019ve seen it in New York City with stark ads: people will quit smoking and you will save lives.<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are no quick fixes and cessation isn\u2019t the result of one intervention. While one intervention can make a huge difference, it\u2019s all the pieces of our tobacco control 5-point-plan in combination.<\/p>\n<p>With all the pieces, we have seen a dynamic culture shift in New York City. Our community went from people asking one another, \u201cwant a cigarette?\u201d to \u201cmind if I smoke?\u201d with most people saying, \u201cyes, I do indeed mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2012InvstgAmrcsHlthNYC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/new-york-city-goes-from-want-a-cigarette-to-yes-i-mind-if-you-smoke","date":"2013-02-22T17:26:13","modified":"2013-02-27T14:48:20","format":"standard","slug":"new-york-city-goes-from-want-a-cigarette-to-yes-i-mind-if-you-smoke","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4885","excerpt":"<p>By Elizabeth Kilgore, Director, Media and Education, Bureau of Tobacco Control, NYC Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene &nbsp; In 2002, New York City elected Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Prior to 2009, premiums had been increasing annually due to overutilization of health care services, poor preventive adherence, lack of attention towards early detection and continual escalation of premium rates. In response to increasing costs of health care the State developed a new wellness strategy known as <em>wellnessoptions<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>State employees who qualify for the new health plan have lower premium costs, access to comprehensive preventive coverage and year-round wellness programs.

We created a medication assistance program (MAP) that helped patients who couldn\u2019t afford prescriptions obtain them.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, MAP advocates, funded in part by St. Vincent Healthcare, assisted approximately 1,200 people with accessing medication worth more than four million dollars. What began as a single access point has expanded to a dozen locations across our community.<\/p>\n<p>The initial collaboration, which began in the early 1990s, between the three organizations became more formal with a Memorandum of Understanding in 2001 to create \u201cThe Alliance\u201d. Chief executives of our two competing hospitals and the public health department committed organizational expertise in planning, communication, advocacy, community benefit and clinical services to help lead community efforts to improve health.<\/p>\n<p>Through a CHNA, we found there was a significant need for mental health services, as hospital emergency departments were being inundated with people who didn\u2019t really need medical care but were admitted because of a mental health crisis. Knowing that emergency rooms are not typically the best place for mental health interventions, we created a joint partnership with the two hospitals to build\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">the Community Crisis Center (CCC), the first licensed out-patient crisis management program in Montana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, the CCC is staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week with a combination of registered nurses, licensed mental health therapists, and mental health technicians. During an outpatient visit, clients are stabilized and assessed to facilitate the development of a crisis management plan.<\/p>\n<p>The CCC has successfully reduced inappropriate utilization of local emergency departments, decreased the number of short-term inpatient hospital admissions, and has been a driving force in reducing the inmate population at the Yellowstone County Detention Facility.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the CCC offers crisis intervention training to law enforcement officers in the region. Officers learn how to recognize mental health distress and de-escalate individuals rather than interacting with people in a way that escalates anxiety. Law enforcement officers credit the training with helping them more effectively respond to situations involving individuals with mental health disorders, especially those in suicidal situations.<\/p>\n<p>One of our crisis intervention program officers, off duty at the time, was driving across a bridge and a man was on it threatening suicide. The officer was able to talk the person down without anyone getting hurt.<\/p>\n<p>This is one example of how a community program has a wide-reaching public health benefit. Instead of the individual hurting himself and\/or others, no one was hurt and the appropriate part of our community\u2019s medical system (the mental health portion versus an emergency department) was involved.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, RiverStone Health underwent an assessment of the public health system\u2019s performance in the 10 Essential Public Health Services established by CDC. The assessment was conducted using the National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP), also established by the CDC. A key outcome of that assessment was an understanding of the need to perform a community health assessment and develop a community plan. The Alliance then sponsored the 2006 CHNA where childhood and adult obesity, heart disease, diabetes, nutritional intake, unintentional injury, and chronic depression were identified areas of weakness. Physical activity, nutrition, and well-being were selected\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">as the areas of improvement because of their inter-connectedness and their collective benefit on our community\u2019s health. The results moved us to thinking about longer term population health improvements through policy, system and environmental change strategies. We began by creating an operational work plan, \u201cThe PITCH.\u201d The Plan to Improve the Community\u2019s Health (PITCH) focuses on physical activity, nutrition, and well-being. PITCH is intended to increase awareness and knowledge of, as well as access to, healthier lifestyles in Yellowstone County.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This plan was developed with a broad variety of community stakeholders who participate in achieving the identified goals as part of a broad coalition. With the support of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, one of the most impactful early Health Impact Assessments (HIA) we completed was with our city\/county master growth plan. Results of the HIA led to the adoption of a new health section within the plan in 2008, which set the foundation for later success in adopting a complete streets policy for Billings. This accomplishment was supported in large part by our work with Action Communities for Health, Innovation, and EnVironmental ChangE (ACHIEVE).<\/p>\n<p>As one of the ten original participants in the Healthy Weight Collaborative, a project of the National Initiative for Children\u2019s Healthcare Quality (NICHQ) and HRSA, we partnered with primary care providers to better document body mass index (BMI) in medical records and, if a BMI was too high, offer a patient-directed healthy weight plan. The efforts have created new collaboration between providers and community organizations.<\/p>\n<p>The partnership has also launched an effort into the worksite by developing physical activity and nutrition guidelines. We found that it is important to create a menu approach of evidenced-based practices that have been shown to increase physical activity (i.e., promoting use of stairwells, on-site exercise classes, etc.). The menu option allows businesses to pick and choose which policies are appropriate in their environment and also empowers employers. A similar project, the \u201cHealthy By Design\u201d (HBD) \u00a0endorsement, was developed as a way of promoting events in Billings that are designed with health in mind. This endorsement is done through an application process and each application is reviewed and evaluated by a team of experts. There are five criteria: safety; nutrition; physical activity; prevention and wellness; and environmental stewardship.<\/p>\n<p>As we look to the future and our interconnected health system, we see a community that is Healthy By Design with active people working to improve their own health and the health of those around them. It is a dream we plan to realize by continuing our work to identify unmet health needs and leading efforts to coordinate a community based response. We recognize the critical importance of key stakeholders in economic development, private business, city government, education, strategic planners in addition to traditional health partners.

2000 and 2010, average health insurance premiums for the private sector more than doubled. \u00a0Across the country, thousands of companies, and tens of millions of employees, face higher health costs every year.<\/p>\n<p>Hernando, Mississippi, is an exception. This year, the town of 14,000 has lowered its health insurance costs by 15 percent \u2014 without reducing benefits. The savings come to $130,000.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor us, that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d said Hernando Mayor Chip Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past five years, Hernando has developed a comprehensive wellness program for its 115 workers. Employees receive free screenings for hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic ailments. They can get free help to quit using tobacco. They are encouraged to exercise regularly.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson thinks the wellness program likely played a large role in the rate reduction. That\u2019s not all. Hernando employees signed a pledge agreeing not to smoke at all during work hours, even on breaks. In exchange, the city\u2019s insurance company lowered rates by another $21,000. Johnson said the pledge is simply good business. \u201cI saved our taxpayers $21,000,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t picture taxpayers wanting to pay that kind of money so our employees can smoke at work.\u201d Johnson said that so far, three employees have stopped using tobacco as a result of the policy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Model For Active Living<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The city is doing more than lowering its premiums.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past five years, Hernando has become a model for how a city can encourage residents and workers to improve their health \u2014 and improve economic prospects at the same time. Leading this effort has been Mayor Johnson, an energetic Republican who owns a carpet cleaning business. Before becoming mayor, he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in prevention or public health.<\/p>\n<p>But six years ago, just after being elected for the first time, he was asked to serve on a regional health group trying to reduce obesity. Soon after, he attended a conference on obesity in the South. As he listened to speaker after speaker describe the medical, social and economic damage wrought by the region\u2019s weight problem, Johnson realized that obesity, and the chronic diseases linked to it, were major obstacles to the state\u2019s health and prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I had my \u2018aha\u2019 moment,\u201d he said. Mississippi is among the least healthy states in the country. It has the highest obesity rate in the country; more than a third of its adults are obese, as are more than 20 percent of its children. It has the highest rates of hypertension, and of physical inactivity among adults. Almost 12 percent of the state\u2019s adults have diabetes, the third highest rate in the country.<\/p>\n<p>In 2008, the state spent more than a billion dollars on obesity-related health care. By 2018, those costs could quadruple, according to a recent report. \u201cThat would bankrupt the state. We need to deal with this. It\u2019s a dollars and\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">cents issue,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur state\u2019s health is holding us back economically.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t think of the economic impact of obesity and other chronic diseases,\u201d said Mississippi State University researcher Judith Phillips, who has examined the economic and medical costs of obesity in the state. \u201cBut it\u2019s a serious issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In some ways, Hernando is not a typical Mississippi town. Over the past 20 years, it has increasingly become a bedroom community of Memphis, 20 miles to the north. As a result, Hernando has a relatively affluent, professional population, and, as a result, has more social and economic resources to support the creation of bike paths and playgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, Hernando remains a thoroughly Southern place, and even if its obesity rates aren\u2019t as high as some other Mississippi communities, it still has its fair share of fast food, Southern cooking, and sedentary living. The town doesn\u2019t keep its own statistics on obesity, but it is part of Desoto County, where a third of adults are obese.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exercise Without Planning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Johnson and other city officials have focused much of their work on making it easier for residents to be active within the context of everyday routines. Although the mayor himself often gets up at 4 a.m. to exercise, he realizes that this approach doesn\u2019t work for everyone. Many experts argue that if people are to burn adequate calories, they must get activity by walking or biking to and from work, or around their neighborhoods. Hernando began by introducing a design standard requiring sidewalks for all new, and some existing, commercial and residential developments.<\/p>\n<p>Research has shown that sidewalks can increase walking by giving pedestrians safe, clearly-marked space to stroll. \u00a0The city repaired crumbling downtown sidewalks, and the design standard resulted in miles of new sidewalks in suburban developments that previously had none.<\/p>\n<p>With encouragement from Johnson, the city also passed a Complete Streets law, which requires new road construction to include consideration of pedestrians and bicyclists. And the city is building almost a mile of sidewalks connecting a lower-income neighborhood to a nearby elementary school, so students can walk to the school more easily.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2008, Hernando has striped bike lanes on several main streets and added new walking trails in existing parks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe city has done a lot,\u201d said Bo McAnich, a Hernando resident and bicyclist who helps manage the city\u2019s bicycle club. \u201cAnything to do with bicycling, they highly encourage. There\u2019s been a big improvement since Chip has been mayor.\u201d The mayor himself takes advantage of the new sidewalks and bike lanes: he often walks to work from his downtown home, and bikes around town.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, Johnson convinced city officials to create a parks department \u2014 Hernando didn\u2019t have one. The new agency has revamped all seven of the town\u2019s parks, adding modern playgrounds to several. KaBoom, a national nonprofit group that works to increase children\u2019s playtime, has recognized Hernando as a one of the country\u2019s most \u201cPlayful\u201d cities, for improving its parks and playgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Three years ago, the city started a weekly farmers\u2019 market, which offers fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats raised by approximately 65 farmers and vendors from North Mississippi. From March to November, about 400 people visit the market every weekend. This spring, to encourage lower-income families to participate, the market began accepting food stamps. The city started a community garden, which is cultivated by a range of community organizations, including churches and youth groups. Much of this produce ends up in the kitchens of Hernando\u2019s lower-income residents.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health \u2014 An Unrecognized Engine of Growth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Johnson sees healthy living as a mechanism to increase private investment. The city is now marketing itself as a site for corporate headquarters. The city\u2019s efforts to improve health play a key role in that campaign, Johnson said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to recruit corporations to Hernando,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not stupid. When they make their decisions, they look at health care costs.\u201d In addition, he notes that in addition to helping people burn calories, new sidewalks and greenways also raise property values.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past six years, Johnson himself has become a poster boy for active living. He regularly talks to public officials around the state and the country about Hernando\u2019s efforts. His message is simple: Get started now, with the resources you have.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are doing the best we can without a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell people to go out and do something, and do it now.\u201d And he points out that for enterprising towns and counties, help is available: Hernando has worked with and received funding from a range of private groups, as well as state and federal agencies. Shelly Johnstone, Hernando\u2019s director of community development, said that over the past six years, the city has received more than $800,000 from various sources for programs that encourage activity and healthy eating.<\/p>\n<p>Some local companies have also joined in.<\/p>\n<p>Williams, Pitts &amp; Beard, a local accounting firm with 18 employees, has held two weight-loss contests for employees over the past three years. This year, one employee lost 25 pounds.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson realizes that his policies and programs won\u2019t reach everyone. \u201cYour personal health is a personal choice,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to create an atmosphere and an opportunity for good health. If you want to take advantage of it, that\u2019s great. If you want to stay home on your couch, go ahead.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But many residents have bought in. At Oak Hill Baptist Church in Hernando, Rev. Michael Minor persuaded his flock to start a walking club, and to measure a walking track in the church parking lot.<\/p>\n<p>With support from groups including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s faith initiative, Rev. Minor started Healthy Congregations, which helps local churches set up programs to help members lose weight and improve their health. So far, more than 60 churches in North Mississippi have joined. He is also working with the National\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Baptist Convention to install \u201chealth ambassadors\u201d in the group\u2019s nearly 10,000 churches around the nation by September 2012.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we can do this in Mississippi,\u201d said Minor, \u201cthen we can do it anywhere.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Hernando%20Miss.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/hernando-a-small-mississippi-town-bucks-a-statewide-trend","date":"2013-02-22T17:09:59","modified":"2015-06-02T17:43:46","format":"standard","slug":"hernando-a-small-mississippi-town-bucks-a-statewide-trend","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4876","excerpt":"<p>Between 2000 and 2010, average health insurance premiums for the private sector more than doubled. \u00a0Across the country, thousands of companies, and tens of millions of employees, face higher health costs every year.

year, when Michelle Obama kicked off <em>Let\u2019s Move, <\/em>her signature childhood obesity initiative, she had by her side the mayor of a city that was taking aggressive steps to keep its residents fit and healthy with new playgrounds, walking trails, bike paths, as well as a farmers\u2019 market and a community garden. The mayor looked the part: He was young and trim, had a shaved head, and often walked to work from his downtown home.<\/p>\n<p>The city was not Portland, or San Francisco, or Seattle.<\/p>\n<p>It was Hernando, Mississippi. Over the past five years, Hernando and its mayor, Chip Johnson, have succeeded in making the city of 14,000 an inspiration for all municipalities with not enough resources and high obesity rates.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson, who has no health background \u2014 he owns a carpet cleaning business \u2014 came to active living accidentally.<\/p>\n<p>After winning election in 2005, he was appointed to a regional health council focused on obesity.

There\u2019s been a big improvement since Chip has been mayor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, Johnson convinced city officials to create a parks department \u2014 Hernando didn\u2019t have one. Since then, the city has revamped all seven of its parks, adding modern playgrounds to several. KaBoom, a national nonprofit group that works to increase children\u2019s playtime, has recognized Hernando as a one of the country\u2019s most \u201cPlayful\u201d cities, for improving its parks and playgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Three years ago, the city started a weekly farmers\u2019 market, which offers fresh fruits, vegetables and meats raised by approximately 65 farmers and vendors from North Mississippi. From March to November, about 400 people visit the market every weekend. This spring, to encourage lower-income families to participate, the market began accepting food stamps. The city started a community garden, which is cultivated by a range of community organizations, including churches and youth groups. Much of the food ends up in the kitchens of Hernando\u2019s lower-income residents.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson sees no contradiction between his conservative fiscal beliefs and government involvement in fighting obesity. This year, he notes, Mississippi will spend almost a billion dollars on obesity related healthcare. By 2018, those costs could quadruple, according to state data. \u201cThat would bankrupt the state,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe need to deal with this. It\u2019s a dollars and cents issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also argues that reducing obesity rates will increase private investment in Hernando. \u201cWe want to recruit corporations to Hernando. They\u2019re not stupid. When they make their decisions, they look at healthcare costs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another plus: all those sidewalks and greenways do more than burn calories. They also raise property values. And, Johnson says, getting people out of their houses and moving fosters a sense of community.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past six years, Johnson himself has become a poster boy for active living. He often walks to work, bikes around town, and visits the farmers\u2019 market. He regularly talks to public officials around the state and the country about Hernando\u2019s efforts. His message is simple: Get started now, with the resources you have.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are doing the best we can without a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell people to go out and do something, and do it now.\u201d And he points out that for enterprising towns and counties, help is available: Hernando has worked with and received funding from a range of private groups, as well as state and federal agencies. Shelly Johnstone, Hernando\u2019s director of community development, said that over the past six years, the city has received more than $800,000 from various sources for programs that encourage activity and healthy eating. Johnson realizes that his policies and programs won\u2019t reach everyone.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cYour personal health is a personal choice,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to create an atmosphere and an opportunity for good health. If you want to take advantage of it, that\u2019s great. If you want to stay home on your couch, go ahead.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But many residents have bought in. Rev. Michael Minor, the pastor of Oak Hill Baptist Church in Hernando, started Healthy Congregations, which helps local churches set up programs to help members lose weight and improve their health. So far, more than 60 churches from all over North Mississippi have joined. At Oak Hill, members measured a walking track in the church parking lot, and members started a walking club. \u201cIf we can do this in Mississippi,\u201d said Minor, \u201cthen we can do it anywhere.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Hernando%20Miss%202.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/hernando-mississippi-a-small-town-remakes-itself","date":"2013-02-22T17:03:15","modified":"2015-06-02T17:55:02","format":"standard","slug":"hernando-mississippi-a-small-town-remakes-itself","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4874","excerpt":"<p>Last year, when Michelle Obama kicked off Let\u2019s Move, her signature childhood obesity initiative, she had by her side the mayor of a city that was taking aggressive steps to keep its residents fit and healthy with new playgrounds, walking trails, bike paths, as well as a farmers\u2019 market and a community garden.

Laura Fitzpatrick, Drug Free Program Manager and Advocacy Liaison, Muskegon Community Health Project<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1997, the Muskegon Community Health Project (MCHP), the local community benefit office of Mercy Health Partners hospital, is nationally known for their health access initiatives which are steeped in community collaborative groups. Muskegon\u2019s collaborative has 65 members from 38 local organizations including those from public health, education, law enforcement, court officials, substance abuse agencies, and health care, student organizations, and a variety of community based organizations.<\/p>\n<p>At the outset, MCHP focused on tobacco and alcohol, forming the Tobacco Reduction Coalition and the Muskegon Alcohol Liability Initiative, an alcohol prevention law enforcement taskforce under the Coalition for a Drug Free Muskegon County.<\/p>\n<p>The coalition began by sponsoring smoke-free restaurant and workplace initiatives, which ultimately paved the way for a smoke-free Michigan.<\/p>\n<p>They also worked on policy, student education efforts, and enhanced law enforcement efforts for both alcohol and tobacco, resulting in substantial declines in student use. Both community-led and supported initiatives steered many youths away from tobacco and alcohol use and abuse and helped them remain happy and healthy.<\/p>\n<p>After several years focusing on alcohol and tobacco, our community turned its attention to prescription drug abuse prevention. The Coalition for A Drug Free Muskegon County, which was originally funded in 2005 from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Association\u2019s (SAMSHA) Drug Free Communities (DFC) program, conducted a youth survey in 2009 that found that 17.4 percent of youth were trying medications that were not prescribed to them due to easy access. In addition, our law enforcement members reported an increase in residential break-ins especially by those seeking prescription drugs.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, other groups started looking at \u201ctake-back\u201d programs that allow people to get rid of unneeded and unwanted drugs safely with no questions asked. Take-back programs are supported nationally by the ONDCP as excellent opportunities to reduce access to controlled substances.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Lakeshore Health Network, the local physician member service organization, began investigating ways to provide education to physician offices on how to monitor prescription drug use and abuse.<\/p>\n<p>As multiple community organizations and resources were focused on take-back programs and prescription drug abuse, we quickly recognized an opportunity to serve multiple purposes with a single process. In September 2009, the Muskegon Area Medication Disposal Project (MAMDP) met for the first time, establishing the need to address this issue. The solution was to create several opportunities for our community to dispense with their drugs safely and securely.<\/p>\n<p>MAMDP held our inaugural event in February of 2010 at a local fire station. We were overwhelmed by the public\u2019s response: 150 participants dropped off 500 pounds on the first day.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, we have hosted 11 events at multiple fire stations, established permanent drop sites throughout the county and collected over three tons of medications.<\/p>\n<p>Of the 7,300 pounds of materials collected in the past two years, 30 percent was over the counter medications, approximately 18 percent comprised cardiovascular medications, 10 percent were diabetic medications and 10 percent, or 810 pounds, were controlled or unknown substances. We also collected 475 pounds of sharps or used needles.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to collecting, we took the process one step further by counting and classifying everything we collected to help inform and then change consumer, systems and local practices when it came to prescribing drugs. We wanted to reduce the source of medications, which would reduce the ability to abuse these prescriptions. We also conducted participant surveys of those dropping the medications off to inform media messaging and better serve the community.<\/p>\n<p>In 2011, the Muskegon Area Medication Disposal Project established permanent multiple collection sites at area pharmacies and law enforcement agencies which now provide a more sustained approach. The future local project continues to build upon its successes and strives to keep educating the community and connecting with local resources.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe numbers tell a compelling story that you have a hard time disputing\u201d, says Joe Graftema, PharmD, Mercy Health Partners Inpatient Pharmacy Manager and a long time MAMDP leader who coordinates the substance counting and classifying at the one day events. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to inform physicians, hospital leaders, pharmacists and health plan managers who can and have changed their practices or policies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At a recent physicians education seminar put together by the project partner Lakeshore Health Network, the MAMDP members were encouraged by the physician response.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were impressed at the engagement and interest that the doctors had in changing their prescribing behaviors based upon the information from our disposal project\u201d said MAMDP Chair Carrie Uthe. \u201cThey were so surprised about the amount of waste that unused medications were creating and the other safety and environmental issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Many communities throughout the country take advantage of federal prevention funding that comes in the form of community building and collaborative organizing through the Office of National Drug Control Policy\u2019s (ONDCP) Drug Free Communities Support Program. The premise of the DFC program is simple \u2013 that communities around the country must be organized and equipped to collaboratively deal with their individual substance abuse problems in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>DFC is a collaborative initiative, sponsored by ONDCP, in partnership with SAMHSA, which works to achieve two goals:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Establish and strengthen collaboration among communities, public and private non-profit agencies, and Federal, State, local, and tribal governments to support the efforts of community coalitions working to prevent and reduce substance use among youth.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Reduce substance use among youth and, over time, reduce substance abuse among adults by addressing the factors in a community that increase the risk of substance abuse and promoting the factors that minimize the risk of substance abuse.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>DFC grantees are required to work toward these two goals as the primary focus of their Federally funded effort and they use a variety of ways to achieve local change in their respective communities.

The processes of assessment and planning that were outlined in the MA AG\u2019s guidelines were recently mandated for all tax exempt hospitals in the federal 2010 Affordable Care Act and in guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While the regulations specify the actions that nonprofit hospitals throughout the country must take to achieve compliance, they also leave room to explore the ways in which hospitals can contribute to a changing health landscape.<\/p>\n<p>At Boston Children\u2019s, what started as a response to regulatory requirements has evolved and matured into an innovative approach to advancing the hospital\u2019s community mission. This process began with the hospital\u2019s decision in 1994 to make community the fourth part of its mission in addition to clinical care, research and teaching.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of the hospital\u2019s community mission today is two-fold: (1) partner with key community-based organizations to focus our collective resources in addressing the most pressing health needs of children and families in the local community, and (2) provide services through program models that not only benefit children locally but will also lead to systemic change. The hospitals seeks to accomplish these goals with an emphasis on promoting innovation to achieve social and health impact locally and contribute to systemic change throughout the health care system.<\/p>\n<p>Since the very beginning, conversations and input from community residents and stakeholders have formed the backbone of Boston Children\u2019s approach to identifying and understanding which local and health-related issues are most important for families today. The hospital\u2019s formal needs assessment, conducted every three years, includes a review of best practice literature, an analysis of health data, and an assessment of current community needs and strengths. It also involves focus groups with community residents and interviews with key stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>In its last formal needs assessment in 2009, Boston Children\u2019s interviewed 29 stakeholders, held focus groups with 91 community residents, and conducted these activities in two languages.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the community needs assessment enables Boston Children\u2019s to focus on how the hospital\u2019s clinical expertise and resources can most effectively address the most pressing needs of children and families, as well as reduce gaps in current services and programs.<\/p>\n<p>One of the major challenges faced by any hospital in fulfilling its community mission is how to leverage limited resources to meet an almost limitless amount of need. Over time, Boston Children\u2019s determined that it could provide the greatest impact if it focused its efforts on a select few health issues in which it could work to produce measureable results. The hospital chose to focus its strategy on those issues that fall at the intersection of identified community needs, existing hospital expertise and available community partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>Based on this principal, the hospital\u2019s priority focus areas are the health issues of asthma, obesity, child development and mental health. Central to the hospital\u2019s efforts to carry out its community mission is its collection of programs and partnerships referred to as the Portfolio to Achieve Health and Social Impact. This portfolio consists of four programs that seek to bring innovation to some of Boston\u2019s most pressing health issues: asthma, child development, mental health and obesity. It also includes three strategic partnerships with key organizations in the city of Boston \u2014 the Boston Public Schools, the Boston Public Health Commission and community health centers \u2014 to strengthen the infrastructure for child health throughout Boston. The hospital manages and measures these programs and partnerships with the goal of demonstrating new models to improve child health throughout the city, state and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>The hospital manages this Portfolio with a triple focus. One focus is to guarantee that the hospital\u2019s investment of resources (human and financial) is targeted to programs that address local needs, alleviate health disparities, partner and engage with our community and provide services through models that lead to systemic change.<\/p>\n<p>Another is to ensure that, by employing a uniform set of standards and criteria, these programs measure value and social impact \u2014things like improving health outcomes and quality of life, proving cost-effectiveness and building community capacity.<\/p>\n<p>A third is to align with the hospital\u2019s overall need to excel in a changing health care environment. The hospital fits our focus areas and interventions into a continuum of care model that looks for ways to prevent short- and long-term illness and eliminate or avoid medical costs. By doing so, the community health programs are setting the stage for a number of key elements of national health care reform, including reductions in medical costs, the patient-centered medical home and population heath management.<\/p>\n<p>One program in the Portfolio, the Community Asthma Initiative (CAI), provides an illustration of this innovation\u2014addressing a health need, delivering services locally and then measuring health and social outcomes to initiate changes that will affect the broader community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Community mission in action: The Community Asthma Initiative<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Boston Children\u2019s had been tackling the issue of asthma for years through clinical services and community-based efforts to help educate families and caregivers on how to best manage the disease. Asthma is the most common admitting diagnosis for children, not only at Boston Children\u2019s but across the nation in pediatric settings. Analysis of admission rates revealed that 70 percent of patients with asthma-related hospitalizations at Boston Children\u2019s came from the neighborhoods immediately surrounding the hospital. In those communities, Black and Latino children had four to five times the admission rate of white children.<\/p>\n<p>Results from Boston Children\u2019s 2003 community needs assessment confirmed what the hospital and other providers and experts already knew first-hand. Asthma was taking a toll on families in Boston neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>More needed to be done to better manage this condition in order to prevent its damaging consequences\u2014poor health status, loss of work for parents and caregivers and missed school days for children, not to mention additional stress and poor quality of life for the whole family.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing on lessons learned in the clinical setting and earlier community-based intervention efforts, the hospital implemented the CAI in 2005 to provide more intensive support to improve the health of children with moderate to severe asthma in the Boston neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, Roxbury and Dorchester. CAI began serving patients from the targeted neighborhoods who visited the emergency department or who were hospitalized because of an asthma exacerbation, as those children were most likely to have poorly controlled asthma. The program was not meant to replace the role of primary care providers, but rather be an additional partner and support in helping a family to manage their child\u2019s every day asthma care and connect patients more closely with their Medical Home.<\/p>\n<p>CAI, which is a nurse and community health worker model, establishes a close relationship with the participating families and provides case management services depending on a child\u2019s unique medical and social needs. The initiative provides a home environmental assessment and asthma management and medication education, while working with the family and child\u2019s health care providers to remove barriers to improved asthma control. The CAI staff truly partners with the families\u2014answering questions, listening to concerns, reinforcing the child\u2019s Asthma Action Plan, which outlines medications to give when the child is well, when symptoms develop and in case of emergency. They also provide education, materials and supplies to reduce home environmental triggers including High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) vacuums, which remove 99.97 percent of particles that are at least 0.3 micrometers, to every family.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to working with families in the home, a nurse provides asthma education out in the community for parents and caregivers by partnering with community organizations, day care centers and schools. Through education and support, the nurse helps families understand that children with asthma can stay physically active with proper control of their symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>After only one year, CAI was able to show that the model could improve health and quality of life outcomes, and it has sustained those results each subsequent year. Participating children in CAI experienced fewer asthma-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits and missed school days. Parents and caregivers also reported fewer missed work days. Equally important, the model proved to be cost-effective. In the March 2012 Journal Pediatrics, CAI reported its program costs as $2,529 per child for the first year of services.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the reduced hospital visits and admissions, CAI was able to save $1,621 per child in year one and $2,206 per child in year two. Essentially, for every $1 spent on the program, $1.46 is returned to society\/insurers. Factoring in the savings due to the reductions in occupational or school absenteeism, CAI is helping to return $1.73 to society.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Changing asthma care beyond Boston<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From the program\u2019s inception, Boston Children\u2019s formed partnerships with asthma advocacy and community organizations to not only address the issue but show that this type of intervention could reduce hospitalizations and emergency room admissions, saving money for the community and insurers.<\/p>\n<p>As the program began to demonstrate success, Boston Children\u2019s looked for ways to expand CAI\u2019s reach to benefit more children than it could through its own direct services. Thus in 2007, the hospital\u2019s Office of Government Relations partnered with the Asthma Regional Council (a coalition of federal and state health, environment, education and housing agencies) to develop a white paper for cost-effective asthma interventions. Based on experiences and outcomes from CAI, \u201cInvesting in Best Practices for Asthma: A Business Case\u201d was written and disseminated urging payers to provide children with access to asthma services such as CAI. This sparked further work with other key partners, the Boston Healthy Homes and Schools Collaborative (BHHSC) and the Massachusetts Asthma Advocacy Partnership (MAAP), to use the business case to advocate for policy changes that would help ensure that all children in Massachusetts could benefit from enhanced asthma care.<\/p>\n<p>After three years of advocacy, the efforts were successful in persuading the legislature to earmark $3M in the FY11 Medicaid budget to fund and evaluate a demonstration project that would provide case management services for children with poorly controlled asthma.<\/p>\n<p>Medicaid then set up an Asthma Bundled Payment Advisory Committee to develop the plan with Boston Children\u2019s and other advocacy partners serving on the committee. Recently, the Medicaid office approved funding for the proposed pilot program and plans to issue a request for proposals to select six pediatric practices to participate.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of CAI is now poised to reach children and families beyond Massachusetts. CAI is providing technical assistance to the American Academy of Pediatrics which is preparing to replicate the model in Alabama. Ohio is also investigating the approach and plans to implement a similar type of intervention. CAI represents what Boston Children\u2019s hopes to accomplish with its community mission, providing services locally in partnership with others to address health needs, while also validating that community-based models can be cost-effective solutions for public health problems. Through all of its community efforts, Boston Children\u2019s aims to show how a hospital can go beyond compliance with its community benefit investments, using its community mission as a way to unite other providers, community organizations, advocates, policymakers and families to initiate long-lasting and significant changes for the greater good.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more on Boston Children\u2019s unique approach to its community mission and the Portfolio for Health and Social Impact, visit www.BostonChildrens.org\/community.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To access a PDF of the story, click <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2013HealthierAmericaXrpt07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/boston-childrens-hospitals-approach-to-community-health-using-programs-to-achieve-systemic-change","date":"2013-02-22T15:35:32","modified":"2015-06-02T18:11:07","format":"standard","slug":"boston-childrens-hospitals-approach-to-community-health-using-programs-to-achieve-systemic-change","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4864","excerpt":"<p>By M.

Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Global Payment Plan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2009, BCBS of Massachusetts began a modified global payment plan, establishing a fixed cost for the care of patients during a specified time frame and included bonus incentives for achieving quality goals.<\/p>\n<p>According to a 2012 study in Health Affairs, health spending for patients covered by this program was 1.9 percent lower in the first year and 3.3 percent lower in the second year than for patients covered via fee-for-service programs, and the 4,800 doctors in the global payment program also scored higher on measures of quality care. The study found many doctors took cost-cutting steps such as switching to less-expensive lab companies or extending their office hours to cut down on their patients\u2019 emergency room needs.<\/p>\n<p>In August 2012, Massachusetts passed a law aimed at controlling health care costs, which included replacing traditional fee-for-service payments for providers with alternative models, such as global budgeting. Some policymakers in the state project the law could lead to $200 billion in health care savings over the next 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>The global payment approach is bolstered by community-focused prevention and public health programs, which supported the BCBS beneficiaries and other Massachusetts residents.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, the state was also the first in the nation to pass its own Prevention Fund to help reduce obesity, tobacco use and other high-impact health problems in the state.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oregon Medicaid Global Budget Approved 2012<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2012, Oregon received a waiver from CMS for a risk-adjusted global budget for the state\u2019s Medicaid program as part of instituting Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) throughout the state.<\/p>\n<p>Their approach is grounded in the idea that \u201cbetter health = lower costs.\u201d Currently, 16 percent of Oregonians receive support from Medicaid and\/or the CHIP services and 11 percent of the state\u2019s overall budget goes toward Medicaid\/CHIP.<\/p>\n<p>The new approach will focus on coordinated care, including increased recognition of the need to support health improvement both inside and outside the doctor\u2019s office. The global resources will help allow for increased support for proven community prevention efforts to help improve the overall health of the community, which in turn helps bring down overall costs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent Advances in Global Budgeting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some recent advances have made global budgets easier to implement than they have been in the past for small, medium-sized and large provider networks, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Electronic health records help give providers increased, accessible information about their patients to deliver better coordinated care and track the population health outcomes of their patients and their communities;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Integrated management systems give providers increased information about the range of potential services and programs that can help their patients, including how to connect them with services and programs that can provide support to manage their health concerns in their daily lives;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Integrated billing systems help with the administration of global budgets and linking payment to care; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Risk adjustment strategies have been developed so the health status of the patient pool is factored into the payment levels, which mitigates against denying coverage or exclusion of less healthy patients.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Improving the health of the community \u2014 or insurance pool \u2014 is one key to the success of global health budgets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vermont Global Budget<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">In FY 2006, Vermont began a five-year \u201cGlobal Commitment to Health\u201d demonstration agreement (which has been extended until the end of 2013) with the federal government to test the impact of a federal funding cap on Medicaid spending to give the state increased flexibility to manage Medicaid health services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The state pursued this approach to help improve cost containment and expand coverage to the uninsured \u2014 approximately one in four Vermonters receives some form of Medicaid assistance.

These hazards increase the risk for illnesses and injuries including asthma, falls, respiratory problems and lead poisoning. Children and seniors in low-income housing are hardest hit by home-based environmental health hazards.<\/p>\n<p>Extensive research by CDC, HUD, NIH, and others confirm that home-based environmental health hazards that trigger asthma episodes and cause home injury cannot be fixed in the doctor\u2019s office but must be remedied by taking the traditional health care system to the new frontier of prescriptive housing intervention services.<\/p>\n<p>Currently severe home-triggered asthma attacks, which result in emergency room and hospital visits, are largely the domain of hospitals, which are somewhat powerless to actually stop these attacks from occurring. The hospitals treat the patient and then send him\/her back to the same place that triggered the episode. It\u2019s a revolving cycle, during which millions of dollars are spent and few are spared from preventable negative health outcomes in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Besides the physical health toll an unhealthy home can have on its inhabitants, the monetary costs are enormous. Total annual costs for housing related childhood environmental diseases are estimated to be $54.9 billion.70 In addition, improving energy efficiency provides financial relief to low-income families by cutting utility costs, better enabling them to meet basic needs, pay for much needed medications and invest in healthy housing maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>Families eligible for federal home energy assistance spend 20 percent of their income on energy bills \u2014 six times more than the national average.<\/p>\n<p>Siloed and fragmented programs across all levels of government and the community undermine the ability of families, and the programs designed to serve them, to adequately address the high costs of unhealthy and energy inefficient housing. Without a coordinated assessment, intervention and investment strategy, residents with multiple housing deficiencies have to fill out countless applications and needlessly endure multiple home assessments.<\/p>\n<p>Far too often this scattered approach has left hundreds of thousands of homes unable to receive energy efficiency investments due to health and safety issues. These barriers leave the families most in need to be the least likely to receive necessary improvements and upgrades.<\/p>\n<p>The Green &amp; Healthy Homes Initiative\u2122 (GHHI) was founded to address these glaring and costly gaps. GHHI, a national program designed to break the link between unhealthy housing and unhealthy children, utilizes a single stream education, assessment and intervention model to revolutionize health care service delivery, health-based housing intervention strategies, housing standards and intervention decision-making in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, GHHI is engaged at the ground level in 16 cities nationwide. In each site, GHHI works with local governments, nonprofits, and private sector entities to implement an integrated health, housing and energy efficiency platform that better aligns the multiple programs currently available to low-income residents. GHHI produces measureable results that demonstrate better service delivery and health outcomes for Medicaid and Medicare children and families and reduce long term costs for health care providers and CMS. In short, people get healthier and health care costs go down.<\/p>\n<p>In Baltimore, one of our sites, we recently worked with the O\u2019Bannon family. Dorothy O\u2019Bannon and her two daughters, aged 4 and 13, lived in the home her family had owned for 40 years. Both girls were diagnosed with asthma, with the youngest daughter having been to the emergency room or hospitalized 13 times in the previous year due to severe asthma attacks, resulting in medical costs exceeding $53,000.<\/p>\n<p>When Mrs. O\u2019Bannon sought services to help her improve the conditions in her home that were exacerbating her daughters\u2019 illnesses, she was turned away by five different publicly funded programs before she was referred to GHHI. Because the problems in her home were so significant, none of the available programs could address the issues individually.<\/p>\n<p>When GHHI performed a comprehensive assessment of her home, multiple issues were found, including: lead paint hazards; damaged roof causing leaks in many rooms throughout the home; mice and roach infestations; little or no insulation causing air leaks and drafty doors and windows and high utility costs; holes in the living room floor; defective plumbing causing mold and dampness. All of the hazards found in the O\u2019Bannon home were causing excessive asthma episodes for the children.<\/p>\n<p>GHHI aligned and coordinated intervention services from seven different federal, city and community programs and funding sources to address the health and safety hazards in the home, completing the work in just four days. The scope \u00a0of work included roof and floor repairs, lead and mold remediation, integrated pest management, window replacement, installation of foam insulation, and weather-stripping and other energy efficiency measures.<\/p>\n<p>The repairs and improvements performed in the O\u2019Bannon home have had a dramatic impact on the health and well-being of the family. Since the work was completed, neither child has returned to the emergency department nor the hospital with asthma-related illnesses and the girls have not missed school as a result of asthma either. In addition, Mrs. O\u2019Bannon\u2019s gas usage to heat the home has been reduced by 27 percent.

the past 40 years, Baltimore has lost much of its industry and half of its population.<\/p>\n<p>This exodus has contributed to the loss of dozens of grocery stores and supermarkets. As a result, many people in inner-city Baltimore must rely largely on corner stores, fast-food restaurants, and carryout spots for sustenance.<\/p>\n<p>This makes it much harder for them to eat nutritious food \u2014 and much easier for them to end up overweight or obese.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the city has an average of 1.75 square feet of grocery store space for each inhabitant; experts recommend that cities should have almost twice that. In many places the situation is worse than this data suggests, because the supermarkets are not spread evenly throughout the city. Ryan Petteway, an epidemiologist with the Baltimore<\/p>\n<p>City Health Department, says that large areas of the city\u2019s east and west sides \u2014 the most densely populated parts of the city \u2014 are food deserts.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, the city health department decided to do something about this grocery gap. It started Baltimarket, a program that allows people in three neighborhoods to order online from a supermarket, and then pick up the food close to home, such as at the library or post office. The program serves neighborhoods that lack a local supermarket.<\/p>\n<p>The city pays for much of the program\u2019s costs, but the Walmart Foundation and the United Way gave $100,000 and $55,250, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The project began by surveying the entire city, mapping supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, and carryout places. The results surprised even the surveyors. Baltimore has 43 supermarkets \u2014most of them clustered in more affluent neighborhoods\u2014 as well as 150 fast-food restaurants and more than 800 carryouts. Not surprisingly, most of the carryouts, which typically sell a range of unhealthy food, including fried chicken and fish, pizza, and burgers, were located in lower-income neighborhoods without grocery stores.<\/p>\n<p>Next, the health department compared this data with other neighborhood information, including poverty levels, vehicle ownership rates, and rates of heart disease and diabetes. Baltimore does not collect information about obesity by neighborhood, so planners used these measurements instead, because high rates of these chronic diseases typically indicate high rates of obesity.<\/p>\n<p>Using this information, the health department chose three neighborhoods that seemed to have the greatest need for healthier food options: Cherry Hill, Washington Village\/Pigtown, and a section of east Baltimore. The east Baltimore neighborhood has six fastfood restaurants, 15 corner stores, and 40 carryouts, and no supermarkets.<\/p>\n<p>The area\u2019s median income is a little over $11,000 per year, and almost three quarters of households don\u2019t own a vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are so few healthy choices in these communities,\u201d says Petteway. \u201cEating routines are shaped not only by the absence of healthy food but by the presence of unhealthy options.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Given the dearth of supermarkets, online ordering might seem like a good solution. But for many people in inner city Baltimore, this solution was impossible. Very few supermarkets will deliver to these neighborhoods; the stores say that it doesn\u2019t make financial sense because they get so few orders from these neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>Even if stores did deliver, the delivery fee is typically between $15 and $20. For many neighborhood residents, this extra charge is too much. In any case, many people in these neighborhoods don\u2019t have Internet access at home.<\/p>\n<p>The health department found a local grocery store, Santoni\u2019s, which was willing to deliver anywhere in the city. To make sure residents without web access could participate, officials set up a weekly ordering schedule at two neighborhood public libraries. One afternoon a week, people can place orders on computers at the library, with help from health department staff, if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Participants who are computer-savvy can order from any computer, at any time. Participants pay regular prices for any food they order, but the health department pays the delivery fee for all orders made through the program.<\/p>\n<p>To streamline the process for Santoni\u2019s, delivery takes place once a week, a day after ordering, at the library where orders are submitted. Customers have a one-hour window to pick up their orders.<\/p>\n<p>Participants are asked to spend at least $20 per order, but they can spend less. The program also allows customers to order any food they want. To encourage people to buy more nutritious items, the city gives each Baltimarket customer a $10 coupon that can only be used on healthy food, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and whole-grain bread.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re very strict. It has to be healthy,\u201d said Laura Fox, who manages the program along with Petteway.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, she notes that the project\u2019s goal extends beyond encouraging better eating habits. Simply by buying items from Santoni\u2019s rather than a corner store or a carryout, lower-income residents can save some money and time. Fox has found that many people in the target neighborhoods do go to supermarkets in addition to closer places. But for most residents, supermarket shopping eats up valuable time and money; each trip typically involves buses and taxis, which can take hours each way.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Petteway and Fox said, people in these neighborhoods, and in many other parts of the city, buy much of their food at corner stores.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019ve found that some shop at a corner store almost daily. In this environment, it is extremely hard to eat right. \u201cYou can\u2019t reasonably expect people to not be at risk for obesity if there aren\u2019t any healthy food options,\u201d Fox said.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the program has approximately 85 regular users. Most customers are women, a mix of older, retired people and young mothers trying to feed their families. In January 2011, Santoni\u2019s delivered 240 orders, which totaled more than $13,000 in grocery sales.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, the health department hopes to attract 200 regular customers and take at least 1,000 orders a year. Department researchers also plan to evaluate how the program has changed the participants\u2019 eating habits and overall health. Fox said that if enough residents join the program, it could be expanded to other stores.<\/p>\n<p>The program is just one of several city initiatives to help residents eat better. Baltimore now has 14 farmer\u2019s markets, which take place once a week around the city. Many of the markets accept food stamps, which makes it easier for lower-income shoppers to buy healthy food. Baltimore food czar Holly Freishtat says there are plans to add two more markets this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Freishtat, who started last year in the newly created position, has also set up a program to teach city elementary school students to read food labels so they can become more discerning about the difference between junk and healthy food.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the effort, students are designing ads for a range of fruits and vegetables; the best ads will appear on the sides of city buses starting this summer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to help Baltimore residents eat better,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can make doing that a little easier, we\u2019re succeeding.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For a PDF of the story, click \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Baltimore.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/baltimore-using-the-web-to-fight-food-deserts","date":"2013-02-22T15:14:16","modified":"2015-06-02T17:52:15","format":"standard","slug":"baltimore-using-the-web-to-fight-food-deserts","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4848","excerpt":"<p>Over the past 40 years, Baltimore has lost much of its industry and half of its population.

And with addiction comes death \u2014 nearly 1,000 lives (82 per month) in 2011, more than from motor vehicle crashes.<\/p>\n<p>The prescription drug problem proliferated largely unchecked until early 2003, when a series of articles was published exposing the addiction and corruption associated with abuse across southern and eastern Kentucky \u2014 a problem chiefly associated with the painkiller OxyContin.<\/p>\n<p>Reacting to this disturbing news, Kentucky Fifth District Congressman Harold \u201cHal\u201d Rogers formed Operation UNITE (Unlawful Narcotics Investigations, Treatment and Education) to provide a holistic, community-based approach to address these problems.<\/p>\n<p>UNITE works to rid communities of illegal drug use and misuse of prescription drugs through undercover narcotics investigations, coordinating treatment for substance abusers, providing support to families and friends of substance abusers, and educating the public about the danger of using drugs. Involving broad-based community representation, UNITE\u2019s volunteer community coalitions are empowered to educate and activate individuals to no longer accept or tolerate the drug culture.<\/p>\n<p>While grassroots initiatives target the most pressing local needs, UNITE provides regional support through a multi-faceted, synergistic offering of programs. These include: treatment vouchers for low-income residents, creating more than 30 Drug Court programs (an intensive alternative to incarceration for non-violent drug offenders), funding residential treatment beds, offering drug-free workplace and community education trainings, creating nearly 100 in-school anti-drug UNITE Clubs, funding a 30-member AmeriCorps program at three dozen elementary schools, and hosting a week-long summer camp for at-risk middle school youth, among others.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007, UNITE was one of 12 organizations invited to participate in a White House Roundtable with<\/p>\n<p>President George W. Bush to discuss the growing prescription drug abuse issue. UNITE\u2019s ability to form partnerships and elicit proactive involvement of communities was touted as a model for the nation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Addressing the Issues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>About 59 percent of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services\u2019 cases of children killed or nearly killed because of abuse or neglect in 2009-10 involved suspected substance abuse by parents or caregivers. Nationally, it is estimated that 75 percent or more of abuse and neglect cases involve substance abuse. Fueling an addiction becomes the primary focus of parents and caregivers, resulting in diversion of limited resources to drugs instead of food, clothing and other needs of their children. In addition, the impaired state of an addict can lead to harmful decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that 75-80 percent of all crime is related in some way to substance abuse.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Kentucky\u2019s medical providers are overwhelmed with drug-related incidents, while the workers\u2019 compensation industry loses millions of dollars annually to fraud. This menace hurts the economic climate and sours a community\u2019s quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Just as the disease of addiction impacts more than the addict, prevention involves more than simply stopping the flow of illegal drugs and diversion of prescription and over-the-counter medications.<\/p>\n<p>Sure we must incarcerate the criminal element, but transforming society requires generational changes in attitude, providing nurturing environments for those seeking to rebuild their lives, along with instilling opportunity and hope.<\/p>\n<p>UNITE\u2019s approach has sought to tackle the underlying contributing causes of substance abuse and tap into the time and talents of concerned community members.<\/p>\n<p>UNITE is currently in the capacity-building phase of a HHS CTG to support public health efforts intended to reduce chronic diseases, promote healthier lifestyles, reduce health disparities, and control health care spending. This program will serve 119 of the state\u2019s 120 counties.<\/p>\n<p>This fall, under the leadership of UNITE\u2019s Medical Advisory Council with funding from an Appalachian Regional Commission grant, a series of five symposiums are planned to educate doctors and dispensers about the dangers of prescription drug abuse and how to use the state\u2019s Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) system.<\/p>\n<p>In order to tap the time and talent of community volunteers, UNITE has created a series of ready-to-use educational kits that trained individuals can present.<\/p>\n<p>Each kit includes promotional materials, a PowerPoint presentation, and step-by-step implementation guide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accidental Dealer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A national study conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University\u2122 in 2011 found 46 percent of all high school students currently use addictive substances, and one in three meets the medical criteria for addiction. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an estimated 70 percent of teens obtain these drugs from family members or friends \u2014 often without their consent.<\/p>\n<p>This kit educates individuals on the importance of tracking and securing your medications in the home.<\/p>\n<p>UNITE recently partnered with Kentucky Employers\u2019 Mutual Insurance (KEMI) \u2014 the state\u2019s largest provider of workers\u2019 compensation insurance \u2014 to provide medication lockboxes to residents.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One-Step Misery: Kentucky Meth Epidemic<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With the number of methamphetamine incidents at record levels across the state, more and more innocent people are being impacted \u2014 not only emergency responders and health care workers, but on work sites, in our neighborhoods and in our schools.<\/p>\n<p>The number of meth lab incidents has spiraled out of control, increasing 400 percent from 2007 to 2011, ranking Kentucky fourth in the nation. This campaign \u2014 spearheaded by Appalachia HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area), UNITE, the Kentucky State Police and the Kentucky Narcotic Officers\u2019 Association \u2014 explains the problem and why people should be concerned.<\/p>\n<p>It also focuses on a possible solution: require a prescription for cold and allergy medications containing pseudoephedrine \u2014 the only required ingredient of meth for which there is no substitute.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Addicted: A Dose of Reality<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This hard-hitting program is designed to give parents and caregivers the truth about the dangers and availability of drugs. The three-part presentation combines parenting techniques, the science of addiction, and the ins and outs of trendy drugs relevant to their community.<\/p>\n<p>Combining video testimonies from recovering addicts and parents of addicts, authentic information about drug addiction is packed into the presentation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Life With a Record<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Currently in production, this kit will detail the consequences of having a drug-related conviction on your record.<\/p>\n<p><strong>National Rx Drug Abuse Summit<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kentucky is not alone in facing the prescription drug problem, now categorized as an \u201cepidemic\u201d by CDC. Prescription drug abuse continues to be a significant and growing problem that cuts across geographical regions, age groups, social class, economic standing, occupation and ethnic background.<\/p>\n<p>Guided by a National Advisory Board, UNITE coordinated the 2012 National Rx Drug Abuse Summit featuring thought-provoking presentations by 100 experts and leaders in five educational tracks: health care, advocacy and prevention, human resources, treatment and law enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>More than 700 stakeholders \u2014 representing 45 states, the District of Columbia and three other countries \u2014 participated in the Summit, which included a forum with members of the Congressional Caucus on Prescription Drug Abuse.

Almost two-thirds of the state\u2019s population is either overweight or obese. Nearly 10 percent of the state\u2019s 6.4 million people have diabetes, double the rate 20 years ago.106 More than a quarter get little or no exercise and just one in five eats enough fruits and vegetables.107 And, more than a quarter of the state\u2019s adults smoke, the second highest rate in the country.<\/p>\n<p>Obesity, tobacco, and unhealthy lifestyle choices all contribute to higher rates of chronic illness, including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and cancer. The result: hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers don\u2019t live as long as they should, experience a lower quality of life, and spend billions extra on health care.<\/p>\n<p>According to a study published earlier this year, obesity alone costs the state more than $3.5 billion a year in health care and lost productivity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are spending an enormous amount on obesity-related disease,\u201d said Marcie Memmer, director of the Indiana State Department of Health\u2019s Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity. The private sector also recognizes that the state\u2019s health holds back economic development.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you look at the drawbacks to Indiana, health is at the top of the list,\u201d said Chuck Gillespie, director of the Wellness Council of Indiana, a private group affiliated with the state chamber of commerce, which helps companies set up or improve wellness programs. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that companies may think twice about relocating here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Over the past six years, the state\u2019s public and private sectors, led by Governor Mitch Daniels, have worked hard to increase physical activity, improve smoking cessation and decrease tobacco use. In 2005, the state rolled out INShape Indiana, an effort to help residents get healthier; in 2007, with the governor\u2019s support, the state legislature passed a significant tax on cigarettes; and earlier this year, the state released an ambitious ten-year plan to reduce\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">obesity and boost residents\u2019 overall health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAdopting a healthy lifestyle is good for you and good for Indiana,\u201d the governor has said. \u201cToo many Hoosiers are losing years because they do not embrace healthy habits. And, health care costs in Indiana are among the highest in the country. Our rising cost of health insurance coverage, combined with lost productivity due to illness, has made Indiana a less desirable place to do business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Daniels himself is a fitness buff: almost every day, he runs, swims, works out in the gym, or golfs (he usually walks all 18 holes). \u00a0His wife Cheri walks 10 miles nearly every day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Information to Help Hoosiers Help Themselves<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The core of INShape Indiana is a website, which serves as a clearinghouse of information for Hoosiers who want to lose weight, quit smoking or otherwise improve their health.<\/p>\n<p>The site includes advice and recommendations on a range of health-related topics. It features information on how to incorporate walking into daily life (walk at work, use a pedometer, wear shoes with proper support), as well as maps of appealing walks all over the state. It also gives advice on how to reach CDC\u2019s recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week (do small amounts of exercise several times a day).<\/p>\n<p>The site is divided into three sections: \u201cEat Better,\u201d \u201cMove More\u201d and \u201cAvoid Tobacco.\u201d Each section offers information on how to be healthier, as well as practical hints about how to reach your specific goals. For example, the section on diet counsels residents to do most of their shopping in the perimeters of the grocery store, which generally includes fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables, dairy, eggs, meat, chicken and seafood. (The central aisles of most supermarkets tend to have more processed foods, such as potato chips, cookies and sodas.) The section also has a list of more than 100 healthy recipes, including vegetable pasta with tomatoes and green beans with roasted red peppers.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the site has a link to a list of every farmers\u2019 market in the state, and a downloadable nutrition log to help users keep track of what they eat.<\/p>\n<p>In the tobacco section, residents can find out how to join a cessation program, and how, if they still smoke, to minimize exposure of family and friends to second-hand smoke. In the Community Corner section, the site lists health-related resources \u2014trails, gardens, nutrition education centers, YMCAs, and so on \u2014 in each of the state\u2019s 92 counties.<\/p>\n<p>For inspiration and guidance, the site also offers stories from people who have improved their health in one way or another. Among those featured is Allison Fore, of Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2009, after hearing the governor\u2019s wife speak about INShape Indiana at the state fair, Fore, who is 49, began visiting the site regularly and going on some of the walks listed there. Over the past two years, she has lost more than 40 pounds. This spring, she completed a 13-mile race, her longest so far. She visits the site about twice a week for events and tips. \u201cI like reading the stories about other people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many of us share the same problems. It gives you a sense of community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Businesses and community groups around the state have also leaned on INShape Indiana for weight loss guidance. The Northwest Indiana Community Action Corporation adapted INShape\u2019s \u201c10 in 10 Challenge\u201d \u2014 an approach\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">that encourages people to lose 10 pounds over 10 weeks \u2014 for use with senior citizens. Participants learned how to exercise at home and eat smaller portions; some lowered their cholesterol and reduced their consumption of sugar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the site went through an extensive redesign to make it easier to use. In addition, INShape Indiana has increased its use of social media, and now regularly posts health information to Twitter and Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past six years, INShape Indiana has also rolled out several marketing campaigns to spread the word about its web site and the importance of being healthy. A survey last year found that almost 60 percent of state residents were aware of the program. Since 2005, 86,000 state residents have asked to receive INShape Indiana\u2019s regular emails. More than 50,000 are currently signed up.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007, INShape Indiana started the \u201c10 in 10 Challenge,\u201d encouraging people to lose 10 pounds in 10 weeks. The campaign included an extensive media campaign, and more than 40,000 people signed up. That same year, INShape Indiana won an \u201cInnovation in Prevention\u201d award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<\/p>\n<p>INShape Indiana also works in the non-virtual world. It helps the Indiana Department of Natural Resources promote its improved network of trails. Along with the state Chamber of Commerce and the Wellness Council of Indiana, INShape Indiana puts on an annual conference on private sector wellness programs.<\/p>\n<p>Gillespie, director of the Wellness Council of Indiana, said the state\u2019s program encourages businesses to do more for workers\u2019 health. \u201cWhen the governor lives it, breathes it and supports it,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes it very hard for corporate leaders to ignore it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said Indiana businesses are starting to understand the importance of encouraging employees to be healthy. His group has 70 members; he expects that to double or triple over the next two years. \u201cCEOs are saying \u2018What can we do to lower health care costs?\u2019\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cThe conversation is starting to move toward prevention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The state has also focused on reducing tobacco use. In 2006, Daniels eliminated smoking at the state government complex.121 In 2007, the state raised the tax on a pack of cigarettes by 44.5 cents \u2014 a move supported by Daniels. \u201cThe biggest impact of a higher price is on dissuading young people or nonsmokers from taking it up in the first place,\u201d the governor has said.<\/p>\n<p>According to the state health department, in the year after the increase went into effect, consumption of tobacco products dropped by almost 20 percent, a decrease of 81 million packs. Earlier this year, a bill to ban workplace smoking was defeated in the state senate. A study by the American Cancer Society found that the ban would have saved the state $84 million in health care costs.<\/p>\n<p>You can access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Indiana.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/taking-steps-to-tackle-obesity-and-smoking-in-indiana","date":"2013-02-22T14:44:05","modified":"2015-06-02T17:43:50","format":"standard","slug":"taking-steps-to-tackle-obesity-and-smoking-in-indiana","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4834","excerpt":"<p>Indiana faces serious health challenges.

Chang, MPH, Vice President, Policy and Prevention, Nemours &amp; Mary Kate Mouser, Executive Director, Nemours Health and\u00a0<\/em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Prevention Services<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nemours, a children\u2019s health system operating in the Delaware Valley (Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) and Florida, offers pediatric clinical care, research, education, advocacy and community-based prevention programs in the communities we serve.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, with childhood obesity rates continuing to climb and associated health outcomes increasing among the children and families we serve, we expanded our mission beyond providing clinical care to include health promotion and disease prevention.<\/p>\n<p>We embraced a model of integrated care and prevention that would improve quality, address rising health care costs and improve the health of the population of children in Delaware.<\/p>\n<p>Our goal was to prevent obesity, type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions, not just for our patients, but for all children in Delaware. We began our efforts in the state of Delaware, with a focus on reaching children and families in the places where they live, learn and play. To execute on this strategy, we created a new operating division \u2014 Nemours Health and Prevention Services (NHPS).<\/p>\n<p>As we looked at the mounting problems related to childhood obesity (in 2006, 17.6 percent of children ages 2-17 were overweight and 19 percent were obese)i and consulted with key stakeholders, it became clear that a multi-pronged approach with a focus on quality medical care combined with community-based prevention strategies offered the greatest likelihood of success. Under the umbrella of the \u201cCampaign to<\/p>\n<p>Make Delaware\u2019s Kids the Healthiest in the Nation,\u201d Nemours worked with partners from multiple sectors \u2014 schools, child care, primary care practices and community-based organizations\u2014 to positively influence children\u2019s behavior and help instill healthy habits early in children\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the course of this work, Nemours assumed the role of an \u201cintegrator\u201d, an entity working at a population level to promote prevention and improve health and wellbeing. We sought to spread and sustain what works, through a combination of approaches, including both policy and practice change. Nemours served as the engine that brought this successful community initiative together by forging strong relationships with multi-sector partners to reach a shared goal, assessing available community resources, identifying gaps, creating continuous feedback loops with the community and leveraging financial resources to support the work, all critical roles that an integrator serves.ii<\/p>\n<p>For example, Nemours, working closely with the Delaware Department of Education, assisted school districts in examining existing wellness policies, strengthening and revising these policies when needed and possible and implementing them at the school level. This effort emphasized two key strategies:<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Focusing on district wellness policies to reach individual schools, taking advantage of the federal law requiring all districts participating in the National School Lunch Program to create local wellness policies; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Supporting the Department of Education in implementing fitness measurements and physical activity pilot programs in individual schools to demonstrate how physical activity can be folded into the school day and the benefits of doing so.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As part of our work with the education sector, we also forged strong partnerships in the early learning community\u2014a group that is often overlooked, despite being a setting where a significant number of young children spend the majority of their day. Nemours identified this gap and then worked to address it through developing a comprehensive approach including promoting policy changes in state licensing regulations to improve the quality of nutritional and physical activity standards in licensed and family child care that would impact 54,000 children in Delaware.<\/p>\n<p>A strong partnership with the state Child and Adult Care Food Program was instrumental in this work. We worked in partnership with early care and education training systems to support providers in implementing these standards, including offering technical assistance in structured learning sessions for child care providers that focused on healthy eating and physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>From a public messaging perspective, a key area of focus for an integrator, we engaged community partners and supplemented our work through our \u20185-2-1-Almost None\u2019 prescription for a healthy lifestyle. This effort encourages children and families to adopt a daily prescription to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables, engage in no more than two hours of recreational time in front of a screen, participate in at least one hour of physical activity and consume almost no sugar-sweetened beverages. Nemours engaged multiple partners in different settings such as public parks in pursuit of a shared goal of promoting healthy eating and physical activity. For example, Nemours worked with the Delaware Parks and Recreation Department to offer healthier food options in park vending machines, helped communities institute community walk days and spread the 5-2-1-Almost None message to schools, child care centers, youth-serving and community-based organizations, and various levels of government throughout the state.<\/p>\n<p>Another important role of an integrator is to facilitate the leveraging of financial resources. In 2011 Nemours hosted the first Outdoor Summit for Sussex County, which brought together county and state officials, school district leaders and community leaders to strategize about how best to promote the need for their members and constituents to get 30 minutes of outdoor physical activity daily. Building from this work to convene and engage partners, that same year, the State of Delaware appropriated more than $7 million to improve Delaware\u2019s walking and biking trails, with an additional $13.25 million appropriated in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>As a children\u2019s health system with a wealth of clinical resources at our disposal, Nemours leveraged data contained in our electronic health record system to establish a childhood obesity quality improvement initiative that not only alerts a doctor when a patient\u2019s Body Mass Index (BMI) is above the healthy weight range but also outlines appropriate follow-up and counseling for families. From 2007-2008, a significant first step was that the number of our providers noting BMI during a well care visit for children almost doubled.<\/p>\n<p>As a complex problem linked to deeply-rooted societal patterns, childhood obesity is difficult to fight. Reversing the trends will take many years. However, Delaware is progressingiii: between 2006 and 2008-09, the overweight\/ obesity rate for children ages 12-17 decreased from 41.4% in 2006 to 35.2% in 2008-09 and the overweight\/obesity rate in Sussex County decreased from 40.2% in 2006 to 38.5% in 2008-09.iv And data from a new, statewide survey to be released in 2013 shows promising indicators, including positive trends in parental awareness of messaging, child behavior and other key areas of intervention.<\/p>\n<p>Delaware\u2019s demographics are comparable to those of many other states; progress in fighting childhood obesity here will provide the nation with important information in this long term battle. Our obesity prevention work continues today, with an emphasis on applying the model we used with great success in Delaware to other states where preventable chronic diseases are taking a toll on the nation\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p>This focus on spread and sustainability underpins our work as integrator. In 2012 Nemours and our partners, including the National Initiative for Children\u2019s Healthcare Quality, Child Care Aware of America, American Academy of Pediatrics and others, will implement evidence-based, practice-tested learning collaboratives in collaboration with local early care and education providers in Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri and New Jersey. Our goal is to help these providers adopt nutrition, breastfeeding support, physical activity and screen time policies and practices to improve the health of children under their care.<\/p>\n<p>Nemours\u2019 commitment to building sustainable partnerships with a proven impact on population health left us well positioned to build on our childhood obesity prevention work by expanding to other health issues, most notably asthma. This expanded work is enabling us to further enhance and build on our role as an integrator, impacting the children and families we serve.<\/p>\n<p>In Delaware, 11 percent of children have asthma, the sixth highest rate in the country. In addition, children under four are twice as likely to be hospitalized with asthma as any other age group and are four times as likely to have asthma-related hospitalizations as adults. To address this issue, Nemours created the \u2018Optimizing Health Outcomes for Children with Asthma in Delaware\u2019 project, with the goal of reducing asthma-related emergency department visits by 50 percent and asthma-related hospitalizations by 50 percent for all children in Delaware by 2015.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve this, we are combining a pediatric primary care medical home model with a population health approach strategy to create healthier environments for children throughout the state. In addition to investing private funds, Nemours has leveraged federal funds from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to support our work as integrator. We are piloting our approach at three primary care sites, with an enhanced family-centered medical home model that brings subspecialty asthma care into the primary care setting. Through this approach, our patients will receive well-coordinated care from an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, care coordinators, licensed mental health professional and community health workers (CHW). The CHWs will serve as patient navigators, who help individuals coordinate, access and manage multiple services and supports by connecting our patients with appropriate community-based services and providing case management of their non-medical needs. The CHWs will coordinate their work with community health liaisons, who partner with neighborhood leaders to develop infrastructure in schools, child care, housing and other systems to reduce asthma triggers and promote a healthier environment.

Diego County has a reputation as a sand and sun sort of place, peopled by slim surfers catching waves and trim Navy sailors walking the beach. But the county is much more diverse than that. It encompasses more than 4,000 square miles, stretching from the Pacific to the fertile avocado and strawberry farms further inland.<\/p>\n<p>It has a population of more than three million, spread over 18 cities, suburbs and unincorporated rural areas.<\/p>\n<p>And, like the rest of the country, San Diego County has its share of fast food restaurants, televisions, Xboxes and cars \u2014 and its share of excess weight. More than 21 percent of the area\u2019s population is obese and another 37 percent are overweight.<\/p>\n<p>Increasingly, public officials in the county, as well as business leaders, are realizing that this problem is more than a health issue. County supervisor Ron Roberts has been concerned about the issue for a decade. He worries that chronic illnesses such as diabetes will slow economic development.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLooking ahead to our future workforce, these people\u2019s performance will be severely hampered,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up paying for that. It is almost like a monster movie. There\u2019s something lurking out there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Research backs up Roberts\u2019 concern. A study released two years ago by the California Center for Public Health Advocacy calculated that obesity and physical inactivity cost San Diego County more than $3 billion a year in health care expenses and lost productivity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cObesity is a massive drain on our country\u2019s economic productivity,\u201d said Dr. Harold Goldstein, executive director of the group. \u201cWe need to recognize that it is not only a huge health risk, but a huge fiscal risk too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>California state officials have also recognized the issue. \u201cThe economic cost to California of adults who are obese, overweight and physically inactive is equivalent to more than a third of the state\u2019s total budget,\u201d California State Controller John Chiang has said. \u201cThink of the programs we could protect, the children we could educate and the families we could help if we could recapture those dollars by investing in prevention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>An Ambitious Effort to Make Healthy Living Easier<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Over the past five years, San Diego County has begun a major effort to reduce and prevent obesity. Last year, the county began a $16 million project to develop policies that encourage exercise and better eating. The project, known as \u201cHealthy Works,\u201d is part of the county\u2019s 10-year strategic plan for improving residents overall health and reducing rates of chronic disease.<\/p>\n<p>The plan lays out a broad strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and respiratory conditions. Because excess weight contributes to many of these problems, the plan emphasizes the need to reduce obesity.<\/p>\n<p>Healthy Works, which is overseen by the county health department, focuses on making longterm environmental and policy changes to encourage physical activity and healthy eating.<\/p>\n<p>For example, county health officials are working with the regional planning agency on its 40-year transportation plan to ensure that the plan includes bike trails, walking paths and other means that promote physical activity.137<\/p>\n<p>As part of the initiative, the health department has focused on increasing the number of community produce gardens. These gardens increase fruit and vegetable consumption, and also help the gardeners burn calories. The department has also created five regional garden training centers to teach garden managers, school staff and volunteers about the best ways to set up a garden and grow produce. In addition, the department is working with the county government to remove barriers that have blocked people from starting gardens. For example, until recently, groups that wanted to start a garden were required to pay a $40,000 start up fee.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Healthy Works is trying to make local fruits and vegetables more accessible to members of the community. San Diego has more than 6,000 farms, more than any other county in the country. They grow a variety of fruits and vegetables, including broccoli, avocados, strawberries and oranges. But very little of this produce goes directly to San Diego stores or tables. Instead, it is trucked to processing centers 120 miles north in\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Los Angeles. (Some then travels south again, and ends up in San Diego stores \u2013 but it is more expensive and not as fresh.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To increase the local availability of this produce, Healthy Works is examining several alternatives: creating a processing center in the county; starting farmers\u2019 markets to sell produce bought directly from county farmers; and linking county farmers to schools and other institutions that want fresh, lower-cost produce.<\/p>\n<p>Healthy Works is also setting up a system that allows residents who receive food stamps to redeem them at some of the county\u2019s 50 farmers\u2019 markets.<\/p>\n<p>Those who enroll receive $20 in matching funds, allowing them to buy more fresh produce.<\/p>\n<p>And, to counteract the effects of billion-dollar marketing campaigns for unhealthy foods and sedentary activities such as video games, the county is rolling out its own TV, radio and web campaign, encouraging residents to be more active and to eat more fresh local produce.<\/p>\n<p>Other groups are joining in too. The San Diego Childhood Obesity Initiative, a non-profit collaboration of several local organizations, is revamping four corner stores by providing them with coolers and refrigeration units so they can store and sell fresh fruits and vegetables. In exchange, the stores, which are in neighborhoods that have little access to fresh fruit and vegetables, must promise to continue selling produce after they receive the equipment.148<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Private Sector Responds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Area companies are also realizing that improving workers\u2019 health can reduce costs.<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, which oversees the San Diego International airport, launched a wellness program for its 360 employees. The Authority built an onsite 24-hour gym (airport employees work three shifts), and added incentives, such as gift certificates and extra days off, for workers who exercise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople say it\u2019s changed their lives,\u201d said Marci Fredericksen, who directs the Authority\u2019s wellness program. \u201cYou can see people shedding pounds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From 2008 to 2009, the percentage of employees with a normal BMI increased by five percent. By 2010, 10 percent of workers had reduced their BMI. The Authority calculates that the program likely saved $1 million in health insurance costs between 2009 and this year.<\/p>\n<p>Software maker Intuit has also developed a vigorous wellness program. The company has about 1,400 employees in the San Diego area (its headquarters are in Mountain View, California, near San Jose).<\/p>\n<p>Part of the motivation is economic, says Intuit\u2019s Sarah Lecuna, who helps run the program.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking to lower health care costs,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we take preventive measures up front, we hope to see cost reductions in the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The program, which is available to all of Intuit\u2019s 7,200 American workers, offers a range of approaches to encourage healthy living. The company offers a free screening program that checks cholesterol levels, blood pressure, triglycerides and blood sugar. Employees who take part receive a $650 reduction in their health insurance premiums; 93 percent of all Intuit workers take part. The screening is also open to spouses and domestic partners.<\/p>\n<p>Lecuna sees this group as a crucial part of the wellness program. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a support system at home, this doesn\u2019t go very far,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a lifestyle change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, workers who pledge to stay tobacco-free for the year receive another $650 discount on premiums. In addition, Intuit provides employees with free pedometers. Depending on the number of steps they take, participants are eligible for up to $300 in cash and prizes. Intuit cafeterias offer a range of healthy choices at significant discounts, and the company also offers free exercise classes, in San Diego and at several other locations.<\/p>\n<p>Lecuna said that because the screening program has been so successful, Intuit\u2019s health insurance costs have gone up slightly, because so many people see doctors after getting screened. However, she expects that over the long term, the program will lower health costs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDown the road,\u201d she said, \u201cwe expect we won\u2019t be paying as many huge claims, because people are taking better care of themselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Targeting Childhood Obesity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The county is also focusing on childhood obesity, which is a costly problem. According to research published this year in Academic Pediatrics, the average obese child costs the health care system nearly $300 a year more than a healthy-weight child. Reducing the childhood obesity rate by just a single percentage point would save at least $1.4 billion a year. In addition, obese children have a significantly higher risk of growing up to be obese, and obese adults spend, on average, $1,400 more per year on health care than healthy-weight adults.<\/p>\n<p>As part of Healthy Works, the county is awarding $50,000 grants to five county schools to develop Safe Routes to School programs, which encourage children to walk or bike to school.<\/p>\n<p>Research shows that few contemporary students expend calories getting to and from school. In 2001, one in ten students walked or biked to school; by comparison, in 1969, the rate was four times higher. The county is also giving out several smaller grants to educate parents, students and teachers on walking and bicycle safety.<\/p>\n<p>The school district is also changing its approach to food. It published new guidelines that encourage administrators, teachers and parents to have healthy food at school events and meetings.<\/p>\n<p>And it is expanding its breakfast program, offering it to more students and making the food healthier. Previously, only 25 to 30 percent of eligible students ate breakfast at school and only three percent of eligible students participated in the summer breakfast program.<\/p>\n<p>Roberts, the county supervisor, is optimistic about his community\u2019s prospects. \u201cWe\u2019re moving in an aggressive way,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to bring positive results. We still have a long way to go. But we\u2019re going in the right direction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To access a PDF of the story, click <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/San%20Diego.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/san-diego-building-an-environment-that-encourages-health","date":"2013-02-22T14:00:08","modified":"2015-06-02T17:38:39","format":"standard","slug":"san-diego-building-an-environment-that-encourages-health","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4820","excerpt":"<p>San Diego County has a reputation as a sand and sun sort of place, peopled by slim surfers catching waves and trim Navy sailors walking the beach.

outcomes and reduce health disparities for the communities it serves. Through FAME Assistance Corporation, its community and economic development arm, FAME is inspiring Californians to make healthier choices every day.<\/p>\n<p>FAME has created several programs and initiatives to increase awareness of the crisis of preventable diseases that disproportionately affects low-income and ethnic minority communities, as well as educate and empower individuals to make healthy choices where they live, work, learn, play and worship.<\/p>\n<p>To connect widely and impact the greatest number of people throughout Los Angeles and California, FAME\u2019s outreach extends beyond its immediate congregation and neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>Through a broad coalition of community partners, including a multi-denominational network of churches, energized leaders and complimentary agencies, FAME reaches the underserved and is committed to creating healthy individuals, families and neighborhoods. FAME\u2019s approach is to work both with individuals and within existing institutions to create new environments that will lead to a lifetime of better health.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Live<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Partnering with the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, FAME offers a series of training programs and community events at local public housing projects to create appreciation for and commitment to the benefits of healthy eating and physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>Offered free-of-charge, residents complete a 6-week Champion Empowerment Program in order to serve as healthy lifestyle ambassadors and change agents in their community. Ambassadors help plan and execute complimentary community health fairs and healthy living classes. The curriculum encompasses nutrition, healthy cooking, physical activity\/exercise, presentation skills, entrepreneurship, community advocacy, and the link between diet and disease. With funding provided by the Network for a Healthy California, Kaiser Permanente and the UCLA Center for Health Equity, FAME impacts thousands of individuals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Shop<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every Saturday and Sunday, FAME transforms its parking lot into a produce market where congregants and community members can purchase fresh and affordable produce. The market helps people gain access to healthy foods, promotes fruit and vegetable consumption, and showcases FAME\u2019s health programs.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2012, in association with Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa\u2019s Good Food Day LA, FAME delivered \u201cHealthy Heritage,\u201d a cooking demonstration and food sampling featuring chefs preparing ethnic foods in a healthier way. Chefs demonstrated how to make healthy tweaks to traditional African American, Latino and Korean favorites to show families how to improve nutrition without compromising flavor.

Over the last two years, FAME has facilitated the dissemination of nutrition education materials and led physical activities at schools and community events focused on creating healthier environments for children and instilling healthy habits that last a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2012, FAME further engaged young people with the Let\u2019s Move Youth Summit. The Youth Summit encouraged young people to take charge of their health, set and achieve fitness goals, and become leaders in their community that advocate for better health.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Play<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An outgrowth of <em>Let\u2019s Move L.A.!<\/em>, FAME launched <em>Let\u2019s Move California! <\/em>in June 2012 with a series of events aimed at uniting and invigorating Californians to eat healthier and be more active. <em>Let\u2019s Move California! <\/em>will create a statewide framework to educate citizens, streamline access to healthy lifestyle resources, and provide training to incorporate <em>Let\u2019s Move California! <\/em>Programming into existing infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Central to the <em>Let\u2019s Move California! <\/em>launch is Fitness Feria, a one-day intensive program to introduce children and parents to the \u201cmovement ABCs,\u201d a fundamental step in early childhood development that enables participation and success in athletics. Families participated in more than 40 sports and fitness-related activities, and learned how to engage more fully in the U.S. athletic system. During the program, parents and children receive instruction on many Olympic Sports and information on where to obtain non-profit resources and support. In addition, thousands of parents learn how to enroll their children in community athletic programs and how to help their families practice a healthy lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Worship<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A core audience for FAME\u2019s programs and message is its broad-based network of churches.<\/p>\n<p>Begun at home and now expanded throughout Southern California, FAME is dedicated to making church place of physical as well as spiritual well-being.<\/p>\n<p>The Body&amp;Soul collaborative brings a series of initiatives and programs to local churches that include health messaging from the pulpit; monthly newsletters; food policies; healthy cooking and exercise classes; community health fairs; and an exercise break during worship services.<\/p>\n<p>In partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles, with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FAME created an Instant Recess\u00ae video \u2014 designed to get people to take 10-minute physical activity breaks. Instant Recess has been adopted by congregations all over the city with plans for national distribution through Let\u2019s Move! Faith and Communities. The video, which has a spiritual and gospel flair, provides churches with fun and active ways to spend 10 minutes exercising while worshiping, specifically during children\u2019s Sunday School, Sunday worship service, choir rehearsal, special events and celebrations, and Bible study meetings.<\/p>\n<p>For a PDF of this story, click <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/FAME.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/first-african-methodist-episcopal-church-reducing-health-disparities-through-education-and-empowerment","date":"2013-02-22T13:36:59","modified":"2015-06-02T17:34:01","format":"standard","slug":"first-african-methodist-episcopal-church-reducing-health-disparities-through-education-and-empowerment","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4809","excerpt":"<p>First African Methodist Episcopal (FAME) Church, the oldest church founded by African Americans in Los Angeles, California, with a congregation of more than 19,000 members, is working to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for the communities it serves.

Rahul Gupta, Health Officer and Executive Director, Kanawha-Charleston Health Department<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Just like the rest of the country, West Virginia and Kanawha County has been battling the obesity epidemic for decades. Across the state, there have been a myriad of physical activity, nutrition and other initiatives focused on helping people get to and remain at a healthy weight.<\/p>\n<p>However, when these obesity prevention programs came in, there was a huge problem with sustainability so after a few years a program would lose funding and disappear. Quickly, residents saw these programs as fads or simply flashes in the pan. A lot of communities around the state felt kind of used, they were put into a program and researched and when the grant was up, the program was gone and, with it, the support, incentives and staffing. There was nothing built into the infrastructure of the community so there was no capacity left to sustain the process.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, as obesity rates and chronic conditions like diabetes continue to increase, this incremental, start and stop approach has failed. Realizing this early on, our community created an independent Health Coalition in Kanawha County that included the local hospitals, K-12 education systems, higher education, business and other people who had a stake and roots in our community. While health and wellbeing is a personal responsibility, it is the local, state and national government\u2019s job to provide easy outlets for citizens to reach their goals.<\/p>\n<p>The founding idea of the coalition was that if there are challenges facing the community, they will be\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">brought to the coalition and they will be solved and resources will be dedicated by partner agencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As the coalition\u2019s benefits to the community became apparent, it was obvious that the state needed more of these county-level coalitions across West Virginia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transforming Communities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When the CTG program was launched in May, 2011, we saw this as an opportunity to obtain the kind of resources and support that could stand up programs and capacity which would then remain in place after grant dollars disappeared.<\/p>\n<p>The CTGs made it even easier to bring stakeholders and institutions to a common table to talk about health. At the outset, we had over 100 organizations interested in being part of transforming the state and local communities.<\/p>\n<p>As we learned our lesson from past grants and programs, we weren\u2019t going to let everyone get their piece of the CTG pie and go home in a silo. We wanted to ensure that each community worked with each other as well as across the traditional silos, so efforts were complimentary, not duplicative. It became evident that the best conduit for the grant money and ideas to flow was through Local Health Departments (LHDs). Our plan was to position the LHDs from all 55 counties as wellness or healthy living hubs for their communities. They would work with the local and state Departments of Education, West Virginia\u2019s Universities and the Osteopathic School to ensure plans would work and were research driven and connected to clinical settings.<\/p>\n<p>While it might not seem like a huge shift, this was a culture change in how resources and grants were distributed across the state. Instead of each LHD getting their money and going home, it was clear the funding was to build capacity, i.e., the resources and ability to do things \u2014 sort of how it\u2019s better to teach a man to fish than simply give him a fish. LHDs were also the natural lead because they were trusted voices in the community and, quite simply, they weren\u2019t going anywhere. Every day, in each community across West Virginia (and across the nation, for that matter) local health employees serve to carry out and accomplish the basic public health needs of their jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, our communities are safer, healthier and protected from deadly diseases. Once we had the framework in place, we went back to communities to understand their needs.<\/p>\n<p>Every three years, our county coalition conducts a needs assessment, which includes telephone\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">surveys, focus groups, and key informant surveys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A community forum, which is open to the public, is held to prioritize the top three health concerns in the county. Once identified, work groups are formed to address these health concerns over the next three years within the county after which the process recommences with a new needs assessment. Examples of health concerns that our community has asked to address in the past have included high rates of tobacco use including second hand smoke, poor nutritional standard, lack of physical activity and prevalence of substance abuse.<\/p>\n<p>While we haven\u2019t been able to create a statewide Comprehensive Clean Indoor Air Regulation\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">(CIAR), that hasn\u2019t stopped LHDs like Kanawha-Charleston Health Department (KCHD) from creating their own ordinances and enforcing them \u2014 it\u2019s great to enact a policy, but the enforcement has to be just as good<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Kanawha County, our Sanitarians conduct close to 5,000 inspections annually to ensure our CIAR ordinance is enforced and we have a near 100 percent compliance rate. To build support in our community for the ordinance, we took not only a policy approach (discussing the medical benefits of clean\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">air), but also a social\/media approach, business approach (showing that it would not hurt bars or restaurants but actually could increase business), and a science and research approach (we demonstrated a 37 percent reduction in heart attack related hospital admission rate in presence of CIAR over eight years \u2014 published in CDC\u2019s Preventing Chronic Diseases, July 2011 issue). Every facet of our community became advocates for clean air for different reasons \u2014 a one-time tobacco-reliant community transformed into one with clean air.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, at a state level, we continue to work toward enacting a statewide comprehensive law. While it has happened incrementally, the capacity and know-how is there across the state. In fact, our local ordinance has been utilized by the state\u2019s Division of Personnel to implement a state employee policy against second hand smoke. Consequently, the state government, without legislation, has adopted a comprehensive clean indoor air regulation for all state employees, which reaches and benefits thousands of West Virginians.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, in doing our needs assessment, it became clear that people simply didn\u2019t have access to safe places to work out and play. There was a huge barrier on the environmental side in our community: there were no sidewalks and the areas with the largest populations had no options for physical activity. We needed to connect those who wanted to work out with safe places to do so.<\/p>\n<p>In Kanawha County, we built a Physical Activity Sites Google Map (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.kchdwv.org\/Home\/Health-Promotion.aspx\">http:\/\/www.kchdwv.org\/Home\/Health-Promotion.aspx<\/a>). It includes a Google map of all physical activity opportunities in the County as well as tools such as walk score, Everytrail and Gmaps pedometer which can be used on mobile devices. The map empowers people to seek out nearby physical activity outlets. We hope to replicate this model in other counties across the state through CTG.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, we\u2019re looking to improve nutrition and physical activity in school and after-school\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">settings, by, most notably:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Farm-to-School Initiatives: We have developed blueprints and guides for county Food Service\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Directors and farmers, giving them the capacity and knowledge to stand up their own \u00a0sustainable\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">programs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Child and Day Care Center Nutrition Programs: We implemented the \u201cBe Choosy, Be\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Healthy\u201d program, which educates and empowers children to choose healthy lifestyles. We have also expanded the \u201cI am Moving, I am Learning\u201d curriculum, which increases physical activity and promotes healthy food choices.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Lastly, our state is supporting the development of community coordinated care systems that link and build referral networks between the clinical system and community-based lifestyle programs that can help people overcome disease and disability and manage their health. We\u2019ve linked clinicians with programs like Dining with Diabetes, Patient Centered Medical Home pilot initiatives, the National Diabetes Program and Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.<\/p>\n<p>We want programs to be complimentary to clinical practice. If a physician is seeing 30 patients a day that need diabetes\/weight loss resources, we need to provide these clinicians with the capacity and information to direct their patients to a referral network outside the doctor\u2019s office. This approach is both time and cost effective and has the potential for healthier outcomes for patients.<\/p>\n<p>West Virginia has worked long and hard to reverse the obesity epidemic. We\u2019ve learned what doesn\u2019t work and we\u2019re beginning to transform our state, community by community. It\u2019s become clear that we need to provide people with the resources to create their own programs and that positioning LHDs as chief health strategists will ensure capacity is maintained and programs continue if grant funding disappears. By ensuring that education, health, commerce and other key stakeholders are responsible for setting and enforcing policy, the entire community truly has a stake in the health and wellbeing of everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2013HealthierAmericaXrpt10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/local-health-officials-chief-health-strategists-transforming-communities","date":"2013-02-20T19:30:30","modified":"2015-06-02T17:42:48","format":"standard","slug":"local-health-officials-chief-health-strategists-transforming-communities","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4933","excerpt":"<p>By Rahul Gupta, Health Officer and Executive Director, Kanawha-Charleston Health Department &nbsp; Just like the rest of the country, West Virginia and Kanawha County has been battling the obesity epidemic for decades.

Many people there hike, bike, ski, walk, and run in the hills, canyons, and mountains surrounding the city.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, <em>Men\u2019s Health <\/em>magazine chose Salt Lake City as the \u201cfittest city in the country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even so, the Salt Lake City area has not escaped the obesity epidemic that has swept the country over the past few decades. Almost a quarter of all residents are obese.<\/p>\n<p>One reason for this contradictory mix of fit and fat is the area\u2019s physical environment. It offers ample outdoor recreation options, it has a robust mass transit system, and several neighborhoods that encourage people to walk and bike.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, it also includes a good number of sprawling, disconnected suburbs that make it difficult for residents to be active.<\/p>\n<p>Many American cities face similar issues. But in Salt Lake City the contrast between the two kinds of environments \u2014 those that encourage physical activity, and those that discourage it \u2014 is particularly striking.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the Salt Lake area has several features that increase opportunities for everyday walking. The region has a growing transit system that includes commuter rail, light rail, and buses. More than 143,000 trips are taken on the system each day.<\/p>\n<p>That number will soon grow. The Utah Transit Authority (UTA), the state agency in charge of rail transportation, is now in the middle of a $2.6 billion project that will add four more light rail lines and another commuter line, more than doubling the current 64 miles of track.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, Salt Lake City will soon begin building a $55 million streetcar line, that will extend over two miles through the downtown Sugar House neighborhood. The project has received significant support from Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker, who sees it as a cornerstone of downtown revitalization. The city is working on plans for two additional streetcar lines.<\/p>\n<p>A former city planner who rides his bike to work nearly every day, Becker has played a major role supporting policies that encourage physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>Under Becker, Salt Lake City has increased its budget for bicycling from $50,000 to $500,000, and hired a bicycle coordinator. The city now has 170 miles of bike lanes, 47 miles of bike trails, and 26 miles of walking trails. This<\/p>\n<p>year it will add another 65 miles of bike lanes. \u201cWe are taking a comprehensive approach,\u201d said Becker. \u201cWe want to increase biking, walking, and transit service. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, but we\u2019re making good progress.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Last year, the mayor initiated a review of all city ordinances to identify those that impede active living. So far, officials have identified more than 300 that they hope to change, including laws that discourage urban agriculture, and mixed use zoning. Blending retail and residential use can help increase walking and biking; when stores are close to homes, people don\u2019t have to drive to go shopping.<\/p>\n<p>The city also boasts several areas specifically designed to encourage physical activity. Gateway, a decade-old development west of downtown, features apartments built above a range of stores, as well as a nearby supermarket.<\/p>\n<p>In recent decades, another neighborhood near downtown, The Avenues, has been revitalized. Built more than a century ago, the area has small lots, gridded street design and sidewalks<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u2014 all of which make walking easier. And next spring, a new development will open, also downtown: City Creek will encompass 20 acres, and will include condominiums, department stores, and a 50,000-square-foot supermarket. Funded by the Mormon Church, it will cost $1.6 billion. Fifteen miles south of the city, another community is also emphasizing active living. Daybreak, a planned suburb, opened in 2005 and will eventually encompass 4,000 acres. Building will continue for another two decades; eventually Daybreak will include more than 162,000 houses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Planners specifically overseeing the development specifically designed Daybreak so that residents can easily walk or bike. Houses are close together, and residential areas are close to shopping areas and schools. Streets are narrow and include sidewalks, which makes it easier to cross and slows vehicle speed. All houses will be a short walk to a park, and the development will eventually have nearly 40 miles of trails. In addition, Daybreak is linked by light rail to downtown Salt Lake City.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a more compact community, and that seems to produce more walking,\u201d says University of Utah professor Barbara Brown, who studies the link between obesity and neighborhood layout. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice example of how a city can be designed to produce more walkability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She and her colleagues found that children in Daybreak are much more likely to walk to school than kids in a more typical suburban community nearby. According to their research, more than 80 percent of Daybreak students walked to school at least some of the time, compared with about 20 percent in the other neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJudging from this, kids in Daybreak get significantly more physical activity from walking to school than kids in surrounding communities,\u201d Brown said.<\/p>\n<p>In another study, Brown looked at how the layout of different Salt Lake area neighborhoods affected the weight of residents. She rated the levels of sprawl in various neighborhoods throughout the area; among other measures,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">she looked at the density of homes; the mixture of homes and retail businesses; number of streets with sidewalks and crosswalks; the number of stores with ground-floor windows (makes being on foot more appealing); residents\u2019\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">sense of safety from crime and traffic problems; and the degree to which a neighborhood had a central area that residents could reach by walking or biking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>According to her calculations, many Salt Lake area communities had high levels of sprawl. Among the most spread-out were large suburbs south of the city, such as Draper, Sandy, South Jordan, and Herriman.<\/p>\n<p>These communities were part of the sweeping national trend that started in the 1940s and continues with the McMansions of today: \u201cAfter World War II, the whole development business changed,\u201d says Reid Ewing, a professor of planning at the University of Utah who studies environment and obesity. \u201cSpreading out became much more important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brown found that people who live in more compact, and hence more walkable, neighborhoods tended to weigh significantly less than those who lived in more sprawling neighborhoods. On average, a typical six-foot-tall male in a sprawling area weighs ten pounds more.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Ewing says, the Salt Lake area epitomizes what\u2019s happening all over the country. As cities and counties begin to engineer and re-engineer communities to promote movement and exercise, they must also deal with the legacy of older areas that in many ways hinder activity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s now a lot of evidence that the built environment affects people\u2019s weight,\u201d Ewing says. \u201cSprawling communities produce heavier people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of this example <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/salt%20lake%20city.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/the-salt-lake-metropolitan-area-both-sprawling-and-walkable-depending-on-where-you-look","date":"2013-02-20T19:22:06","modified":"2015-06-02T17:38:45","format":"standard","slug":"the-salt-lake-metropolitan-area-both-sprawling-and-walkable-depending-on-where-you-look","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4926","excerpt":"<p>Salt Lake City has a reputation as a city whose residents are physically active.

At the same time, a local pediatrician noticed that a significant portion of his pediatric patients had conditions that used to be adult problems (high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, sleep apnea and obesity).<\/p>\n<p>He began to talk with the local hospital about this and they brought in other members of the community, including the local school district. Later, the county government and a commercial insurer got involved. As time went on, others were added to the group such at the YMCA, 4-H, local recreational groups, businesses and parents.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, when we looked at the older BMI data, we realized a large portion of children entering kindergarten were within the normal weight range, but, as they went through elementary school, their BMIs went up before plateauing in high school. More recently, we noticed that kids entering kindergarten were now overweight and obese, so we shifted to focus on birth to school age and added more of a family\/community focus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Making the Healthy Choice the Easier Choice<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In schools, we removed all vending machines that contained junk food and sugary beverages from\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">student areas and replaced them with healthy machines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, we no longer have deep fryers in our schools and sell nothing fried. While we do serve a form of fries, they are baked and are served les frequently. Instead, we provide fruits and vegetables at every single meal and we also use only whole grain products and serve 1% and skim milk.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the first few years, the school district increased the amount of fresh fruit and vegetables purchased by more than $50,000 per year. In 2003, the school district purchased $61,930 worth of fresh fruits and vegetables. In 2006, that figure more than doubled to $136,197.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to changing the food that\u2019s available, we had to shift the culture. At each school building, there is a wellness facilitator who plans and implements in-school and after school activities that are either physical or include lessons about nutrition. Also, every secondary school has a morning walking program \u2014 so when kids arrive, instead of standing around, they have walking clubs and each elementary\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">school has morning exercises that are announced over the loudspeaker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve received positive feedback from many members of the community. One mother wrote to us detailing her experience with her daughter.<\/p>\n<p>She said, my child was considered fat, but once we acknowledged the issue, we took steps to address the problem. The whole family participated in helping her lose weight and we all look better and feel better. At first it was hard to break bad habits, but we drew upon community services and are much happier.<\/p>\n<p>The work we\u2019ve done with schools and families has spread throughout the community. In the\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">summer, the hike and bike event draws tons of interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, our Healthy Lifestyle Extravaganza, which is held at the local vocational education school, includes exercise stations. At the event, kids rotate from station to station and obtain tickets and the tickets are turned in for door prizes. There is also a healthy cooking demonstration by the culinary students: where students learn how to make healthy snacks and then get to eat them!<\/p>\n<p>We have dramatically shifted the culture in our schools and community. In October of 2006, kids in the Armstrong School District participated in 402,142 minutes of physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>Two years later, students participated in 796,260 minutes of physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>By focusing on the entire community, we can help children and families strive to be healthier.<\/p>\n<p>Our story shows that if you provide the resources and tools, families know what to do with them.

Nothing less than the long term well-being of the country is at stake. It is therefore incumbent on the health care sector to not only deliver the best patient outcomes at the lowest possible cost, but also to reduce demand on the healthcare system overall, and contribute to the health of our population by embracing prevention as a central element of providing value.<\/p>\n<p>In everything we do at Kaiser Permanente, our aim is to measurably improve the health of our members and the communities we serve. As an integrated health care system serving more than nine million members in nine states and the District of Columbia, primary community prevention is a top priority. The National Committee for Quality Assurance recently published its annual 2012 report ranking health plans in three categories: Medicare, Medicaid and Private (Commercial). For the second year in a row, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s three largest regions, totaling nearly seven million members, had the top three Medicare health plans in the nation. Our success demonstrates the dedication of our physicians and care teams working collaboratively to create a better, safer patient experience. But it also reflects our commitment to work with local, state, and national partners to prevent disease, improve population health status, and address the underlying determinants of health and drivers of disparities. We are committed to helping our members, our workforce, their families, and our communities achieve Total Health through the services we provide, and by promoting clinical, educational, environmental, and social actions that improve the health of all people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Total Health<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To accomplish our aim of making lives better, we bring four primary resources to bear:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Clinical Quality: <\/strong>We have 17,000 physicians. In addition to providing high quality care, our physicians are responsible for making primary prevention in the clinical environment a major component of care. Further, they bring a valuable medical voice to local, state and national initiatives working on priorities such as increasing regular physical activity, and providing access to healthy affordable foods.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Behavior Change: <\/strong>We work closely with our members and corporate customers to employ strategies that help people eat more nutritious foods, be more physically active, quit tobacco, and use alcohol only in moderation. These are the four primary risk factors that lead to the big-four killers: cardio-vascular disease, diabetes, some cancers, and chronic respiratory disease. These are the primary chronic diseases which are the leading driver of the spiraling demand for, and cost of health care in our nation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Healthy Environments: <\/strong>When we talk about environments, we include built, food and beverage environments, as well as social, cultural and natural environments. To support the guidance we provide to patients in the clinical setting, it is vital to help support healthy behavior choices where people live, learn, work, pray and play. We work collaboratively with our community partners to ensure that the healthier \u00a0choices are the easier choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Community Engagement and Grantmaking: <\/strong>In addition to providing extensive charity care and coverage to low income\/ high need residents of the communities we serve, we are also investing in over 40 long-term community health initiatives that employ evidence-informed best practices derived from decades of learning. We do this via targeted grantmaking, convening, and partnering with trusted community organizations such as community health centers, schools and after school programs, farmers markets, YMCA\u2019s, and faith based programs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Obesity Prevention and Treatment: <\/strong><strong><em>Exercise as a Vital Sign<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is no equivocating: obesity is driving multiple chronic conditions that are seriously damaging the health status of our nation, while concurrently driving up medical care costs. Underlying obesity is the epidemic of physical inactivity which places inactive individuals at risk of disease at every weight.<\/p>\n<p>As an integrated delivery system, Kaiser Permanente is applying its full array of resources to prevent our members from becoming obese and\/or developing chronic conditions such as type-2 diabetes and hypertension. In the clinical environment, we now we routinely ask patients about their physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>We call this Exercise as a Vital Sign. For many years, our doctors have asked patients whether they smoke, and then guided users of tobacco products to the means to quit. Now, we ask how active you are, and then provide an array of means to support recommended physical activity. Physical inactivity, even in people who appear to be fit or skinny, is a significant predictor of long-term chronic disease. If people say they aren\u2019t physically active, or get less than the recommended 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day, five days a week our doctors make recommendations, increasingly linking to our community partners, to encourage activity. For example, a pre-diabetic patient might be referred to a YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program or the programmatic offerings of a faith-based partnership or community recreation center.<\/p>\n<p>We have to go beyond saying \u201cyou need to walk more, or be more physically active.\u201d So, our physicians write walking prescriptions for patients. In turn, we are beginning to connect patients with safe, convenient, affordable community resources that support walking and physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>There is no simpler, more powerful, more enjoyable thing we can do for our health than taking a brisk walk 30 minutes a day, five days a week! The health benefits for body, mind, and spirit are proven and well documented. Walk with your family and friends.<\/p>\n<p>Walk the kids to school. Have a walking meeting. Walk the dog! In short, we may offer the highest quality health care in the nation, but, if our members leave the doctor\u2019s office, and go back into their daily lives and community settings where there are inadequate supports to healthier lifestyles \u2014 we miss the opportunity to optimize our individual and collective health potential. At a time when health care costs\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">are rising we all need to do what we can to improve prevention and keep people out of the care delivery system to start with<strong>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Going Into Our Communities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many health-related organizations and foundations provide funding for community efforts. We\u2019re a bit different in our grantmaking and community partnership work \u2014 as we are not a philanthropy, rather a not for profit integrated health system, with a long-term stake in the communities we serve and the health of the nation. We regularly engage in community benefit activity by assessing community health needs, making investments in priority areas, and tracking outcomes over time.<\/p>\n<p>Our employees and members are with us for the long term, and our facilities and investments are rooted in place. In short, we\u2019re not going anywhere. So we don\u2019t simply make shortterm grants and then move on. As a nonprofit mission-driven organization, we invest in our communities over the long term, to encourage and support changes that go beyond what we can do in our clinical settings alone.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, when engaging in community partnerships, we typically engage for a minimum of seven to ten years. To affect measurable population level behavior and health changes, you can\u2019t make a grant, and then expect lasting change in just two to three years. We take a longer view, focusing on community\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">assets and environments, and help build the long-term capacity of community partners. The latter is vital so that communities build the collective efficacy that is requisite to effecting measurable impact, at scale, with sufficient reach and intensity, over time. The stronger community bonds and assets we help forge,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">the better our clinical offerings can integrate with community supports in a way that assures total health and well-being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We also practice what we preach and apply the \u201cpower of the white coat.\u201d Our physicians often volunteer with community partnerships. Over the years, they have stepped up to educate on the health benefits of Safe Routes to School, Complete Streets, and the importance of neighborhood safety and affordable access to healthy foods.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Every Body Walk!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Walking is central to everything we do at Kaiser Permanente. Every Body Walk!, a national public health campaign, powered by Kaiser Permanente, aims to get adult Americans walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week (60 minutes for children). The online walking hub at everybodywalk.org contains all that\u2019s needed to begin a walking routine \u2014 maps, tips, medical advice, partner resources, inspiring videos, and a free mobile application.<\/p>\n<p>We know that walking can cut the rate of diabetes and heart disease and even Alzheimer\u2019s. It\u2019s fun, easy and free and has amazing health benefits. That\u2019s why our doctors are advocating the benefits of walking and getting out to walk with their patients.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Community Health Initiatives<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our Community Health Initiatives take a preventive approach to health care, focusing on policies and programs that promote healthy eating and active living where we live, learn, work, and play. Community health improves in an environment that promotes health and wellbeing and the creation of that environment is accomplished through providing the best medicine combined with education and vital public health activities that support an informed and empowered population.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Educational Theatre<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kaiser Permanente created Educational Theatre Programs (ETPs) to inspire children, teens and adults to make informed decisions about their health, to build stronger, healthier neighborhoods, and to improve public health by using the arts, creative education and youth advocacy.<\/p>\n<p>Our ETPs are presented free of charge to schools and community organizations and performed in school and community settings. Over the past 25 years, the Program has reached 15 million children. Kaiser Permanente\u2019s ETPs use live theatre, music, comedy, and drama to inspire children, teens, and adults to make healthier choices and better decisions about their well-being. ETP\u2019s live, interactive performances enable students to identify and emotionally engage with characters onstage, as well as learn information in a dynamic way. ETP productions are offered free of charge to eligible schools and community groups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>National Partnerships:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nationally, Kaiser Permanente engages in a wide array of partnerships including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The Convergence Partnership supports healthy policy change at all levels, promoting and supporting partnerships among organizations and entities in multiple fields. <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.convergencepartnership.org\">www.convergencepartnership.org<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The Weight of the Nation\u2122 documentary series and public health campaign presents a unique opportunity to spotlight the severity of the obesity epidemic, to showcase strategies that work and, most importantly, to catalyze action to end obesity. <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http:\/\/theweightofthenation.hbo.com\/\">http:\/\/theweightofthenation.hbo.com\/<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> and <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kp.org\/weightofthenation\">www.kp.org\/weightofthenation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The Community Commons is an interactive GIS mapping, networking, and learning utility for the healthy, sustainable, and livable communities\u2019 movement. <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.communitycommons.org\">www.communitycommons.org<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">CHNA.org is a free web-based platform designed to assist critical access hospitals, non-profit organizations, state and local health departments, financial institutions, and other organizations seeking to better understand the needs and assets of their communities \u2014 to make measurable improvements in community health and well-being.www.chna.org<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Everywhere Kaiser Permanente operates, our mission remains the same: to provide high-quality affordable health care and to improve the health of our members and the communities we serve.

With wise private and public sector investments in prevention and public health, we can concurrently improve our nation\u2019s health, while lowering the preventable demand-driven costs of care over time. This is good for people, good for our communities, and good for our nation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MAZON: Healthy food in hard times<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Kaiser Permanente is proud to partner with MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, in <\/em>Healthy Options, Healthy Meals<em>, a groundbreaking national initiative to make healthy and nutritious food more accessible for low-income families. Feeding America food banks in the eight Kaiser Permanente regions were invited to participate in this two-and-a-half year initiative, which aims to strengthen their capacity to achieve their healthy food goals, wherever they may be along the healthy eating continuum. Healthy Options, Healthy Meals is designed to be collaborative not prescriptive; together, MAZON and participating food bank partners will co-create a process for change and help shape how the food bank community conducts this type of work. MAZON will provide a framework for approaching this important work, as well as technical resources and a peer-to-peer network. MAZON will also provide individualized support, assisting each food bank in customizing a plan that is tailored to its needs and strategic goals on its path to becoming a stronger change agent and community resource for healthy eating.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Farmers Market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Each year, more than 30,000 people attend Green Market \u2013 a Farmers market held every Saturday from May through October in Piedmont Park, Atlanta, Georgia \u2013 which offers a variety of organic fruits, vegetables, fresh cut flowers, baked goods and more. In addition to the marketplace, the event offers healthy cooking demonstrations and fitness classes to encourage everyone to get healthy and stay healthy.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Food Oasis in Oregon <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>The Village Gardens project unites three neighborhoods \u2014 St. John\u2019s Woods, New Columbia, and Tamarack \u2014 with people working together to create an oasis of food security. Community gardens are staffed and tended to by nearly 100 families representing 18 different nationalities. Future goals are to serve the 10,000 people living within a half-mile radius, and to be a model that others can use to create a healthier, more sustainable force in their community.

This effort sought to mobilize and partner with Colorado communities to develop programs, environmental strategies, and policies that will work best in their respective neighborhoods to promote healthy eating and active living. Eleven community<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>organizations were provided funding and resources through the Thriving Communities initiative to collaborate with local health organizations, businesses, neighborhood associations, faith-based organizations, local government, and parks and recreation departments in assessing needs and developing plans towards reaching their goals. Each of the 11 communities developed unique programs aimed at improving healthy eating and increasing active living.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The activities ranged from teaching nutrition through growing and maintaining gardens to improving local roads and infrastructure for better walking accessibility. Kaiser Permanente Colorado continued to develop partnerships to support the Thriving Communities initiative, including working with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, The Colorado Health Foundation, Governor Bill Ritter, and Lt. Gov. Barbara O\u2019Brien. Through these partnerships, Thriving Communities evolved into the statewide initiative now called LiveWell Colorado.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Today, <\/em>LiveWell Colorado <em>provides support to 17 community organizations serving about 750,000 people in 11 Colorado counties (Adams, Alamosa, Broomfield, Denver, Eagle, El Paso, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Prowers, and Summit).

Because Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are locally operated, they have an ability to create programs that meet each community\u2019s specific needs. Yet this nationwide network also enables the Blues to take the best of what works at the local level and replicate or adapt it to\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">work in other communities across the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are using their resources, including hundreds of employee volunteers, to promote wellness and the prevention of disease, with many of these programs focused on increasing physical activity and promoting healthier nutrition choices. These activities can help reduce obesity, which leads to heart disease, diabetes and other chronic illnesses that take a terrible toll\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">on patients and their families and lead to higher healthcare costs for everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Programs are tailored to meet the needs of rural and urban communities, as well as the particular needs of diverse ethnic and cultural communities where access to care and prevention information often is lacking. Successful programs are expanded statewide and in some cases, nationwide. They are already showing concrete results:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Individual Cities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2011, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska partnered with Live Well Omaha, a long-term collaborative partner for improving the overall health of area residents and positioning Omaha as a thriving community, and Community Bike Project Omaha, which works to improve access to bicycles for everyone. Together they launched Omaha B-cycle, the first large-scale municipal bike sharing system in Omaha. The goal of Omaha B-cycle is to provide a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and healthy way for riders to make quick trips or enjoy the city\u2019s riding trails. B-cycle riders also help keep pounds of pollutants out of the air, conserve fuel, and burn calories.<\/p>\n<p>To use B-cycle, participants select a bike, swipe a membership card or credit card, ride the bike and then return it to one of the five stations located throughout the city. Since its start, 850+ members burned an estimated 606,972 calories during an impressive 2,389 trips on B-cycle bikes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diverse Racial and Ethnic Communities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are working to address healthcare disparities in low-income and ethnically diverse communities by tailoring approaches for the local communities they serve. In Western Pennsylvania, Highmark Inc. became the first Blue Cross and Blue Shield company to receive a Distinction in Multicultural Health Care by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). The award specifically recognizes Highmark\u2019s commercial HMO and Medicare Advantage HMO products offered under the Keystone Health Plan West subsidiary. Clinical interventions targeting minority patients\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">have improved hypertension medication adherence, blood pressure control, colorectal cancer screening rates and diabetes care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Statewide Initiatives<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>North Carolina<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina\u2019s Nourishing North Carolina is a statewide community gardening program that makes locally grown, healthy food more accessible to communities across the state. The program, which began in 2011, provides resources to create or enhance community gardens in each of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties. This innovative program involves collaboration between the community, the local public school system, health department and parks and recreation departments.<\/p>\n<p>Community residents and elementary school students volunteer weekly to maintain the garden, sharing both in the work and rewards that come from home grown food. Gardens located in food deserts or areas that will be providing fresh produce to underserved\/at-risk-populations are given higher consideration over other applicants. A food desert is any area where healthy, affordable food is difficult to obtain.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Nourishing North Carolina supported 25 community gardens across 19 counties. More than two tons of produce from these gardens was donated to food shelter and rescue organizations.<\/p>\n<p>To date, Nourishing North Carolina supports a total of 55 community gardens across 41 counties. In addition, the gardens have also offered hundreds of hours of physical activity to community volunteers. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina also established its own community garden, maintained by employees, on its office campus. All of the garden\u2019s produce is donated to a local organization that provides food to the needy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Iowa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Iowa ranks as the 16th healthiest state in the nation and in August 2011, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad issued a statewide challenge to make Iowa the Healthiest State in the nation by 2016 as measured by the Gallup Healthways Well-Being Index\u00ae. Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa is playing a major<\/p>\n<p>role toward achieving this goal through their support of the Blue Zones Project\u2122. \u201cBlue Zones\u201d is a phrase coined by Dan Buettner, National Geographic author and researcher, and refers to areas in the world where people are not only living longer, but are also living healthier and happier. The research<\/p>\n<p>has been used to develop tools and programs that are being applied through a community-by-community movement to improve the well-being of all Iowans. By encouraging systematic environmental change that optimizes the places where we live, work and play, the healthy choice will become the easy choice.<\/p>\n<p>Four Iowa communities \u2014 Mason City, Waterloo, Cedar Falls and Spencer \u2014 were selected as the initial demonstration sites in May of 2012. Six additional Iowa communities with populations of more than 10,000 will be announced in January 2013, for a total of 10 Blue Zones Project demonstration sites of this size. Additional demonstration sites with populations of less than 10,000 citizens will be selected and the first round of those will be announced in October 2012.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Multi-State Initiatives<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Last year, Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) launched the Healthy Kids, Healthy Families initiative with the goal of improving the health and wellness of at least one million children over three years across its health plans at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. Healthy Kids, Healthy Families focuses its efforts in four areas: nutrition education, physical activity, managing and preventing disease, and supporting safe environments.<\/p>\n<p>Key 2011 partners included: OrganWise Guys, a school-based program that encourages children to take charge of their health; KaBOOM!, which builds safe, new playgrounds to encourage physical activity; and the Care Van program, which provides preventive care to the uninsured and medically underserved. In 2011, the Healthy Kids, Healthy Families initiative provided funding in 49 schools, helping to improve nutrition education for approximately 24,500 students. It also helped build nine new playgrounds that served more than 23,000 children and provided more than 145,000 immunizations to kids in need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>National Programming<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Blues\u2019\u00ae projects in local communities, BCBSA also has national programming and sponsorships that encourage healthier living for all Americans. For example, BCBSA recently joined with the First Lady\u2019s Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) to sponsor 40 new Play Streets \u2014 roads closed to traffic and open to the community to encourage physical activity. Cities and towns across the U.S. are invited to apply for funding that will create at least four Play Streets per locality. Ten cities<\/p>\n<p>are to be chosen based on their on-going commitment to increasing physical activity among kids; health education and programming; sustainability of the program concept; and community development. They will receive funds and support from PHA and BCBSA for the events in their city or town.<\/p>\n<p>Cities that already have begun participating have seen an immediate impact. In New York City, 64 percent of the kids using Play Streets reported that, if not for the local Play Street, they would have been engaged in a sedentary activity. Seventy-one percent reported that they walked to their Play Street, an added benefit.<\/p>\n<p>The same survey also underscored the promise that Play Streets holds for local economic development: Area businesses reported that foot traffic around the Play Streets increased greatly. BCBSA is committed to maintaining and expanding these initiatives and others like them to help people live healthier lives.<\/p>\n<p>This effort will also help transform our nation\u2019s healthcare system from one that focuses on treating chronic, preventable disease at great expense to one that helps prevent illnesses and thus helps to curb costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2013HealthierAmericaXrpt02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/the-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-association-creating-a-healthier-america-one-community-at-a-time","date":"2013-02-12T21:03:44","modified":"2013-02-22T21:08:06","format":"standard","slug":"the-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-association-creating-a-healthier-america-one-community-at-a-time","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4965","excerpt":"<p>By, Dr. Allan Korn, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer (Ret), Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association &nbsp;

It has operated as a small business since Eisenhower was president.<\/p>\n<p>One key to the company\u2019s longevity has been its skilled workforce. Keeping this workforce healthy is crucial to its continued success.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the company\u2019s 18 employees are middleaged males \u2014 the average age is a little over 50.<\/p>\n<p>According to Melody Waggoner, the company\u2019s human resources manager, about two-thirds of these workers are either obese or overweight.<\/p>\n<p>Like many smaller companies, Creative Craftsmen does not have a large staff or budget for human resources or health care. It is a family-owned business, and Waggoner, who is the daughter of one of the owners, wears several hats, including human resources manager and accountant.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007 Creative Craftsmen started a wellness program to help employees exercise more, eat healthier foods and stop smoking. The company hired a local health care provider, Deaconess Hospital, to set up and run the program. By taking this step, Creative Craftsmen is rather unique: according to a 2011 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, just 12 percent of small businesses set up their own wellness programs.<\/p>\n<p>The rest have programs that are provided by their health plan.<\/p>\n<p>Waggoner said the company started the program because its owners believe that healthier, happier employees are more productive. Again, this puts the company in the minority: the Kaiser survey also found that one-quarter of small employers offered a wellness program to improve employees\u2019 health, while 9 percent offered it to improve morale and productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly half said they offered a wellness program because it was part of their health plan. Currently, the company, whose annual sales range between $2.5 million and $3.5 million, spends about $4,000 a year on its wellness program. Through 2011, Creative Craftsmen was reimbursed for half the cost of its program thanks to an Indiana tax credit that helped defray companies\u2019 wellness program costs. However,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">that credit was suspended for 2012.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The program is managed by Emily Boyd, a health coach at Deaconess. With her help, the company now has a solid program. One key piece of the effort is an annual screening program that checks employees\u2019 BMI and body fat levels, and tests for diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Waggoner\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">said that 90 percent of employees participate in the screenings. Through the screenings and conversations with employees, Boyd found that a significant number of Creative Craftsmen\u2019s employees needed to manage their weight, exercise more and improve their diet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>She helped them develop plans to improve on areas that fell into the risky category, and regularly checks in on the participants&#8217; progress.<\/p>\n<p>Spouses are also eligible for the screenings, as well as a free flu shot.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, the screenings have had a significant impact. For instance, two years ago, tests revealed that the company\u2019s owner and founder, Tom Pfender, had diabetes. At the time, Pfender (who is Waggoner\u2019s father) had no idea that he had the disease. Since then, he has begun exercising and is eating healthier. As a result of these changes, and the medication he now takes, his diabetes is under control.<\/p>\n<p>Boyd said that employees at Creative Craftsmen are sometimes set in their ways, and can be reluctant to alter their behavior. In 2012, she is trying a new, incentive-based approach to make it easier for them to make healthier choices.<\/p>\n<p>She said that some of the company\u2019s employees have quit smoking or lost a significant amount of weight. In some cases, however, they have started smoking again or regained the lost weight. But Boyd remains optimistic about their longterm success. \u201c[The backsliding] usually has to do with stress,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to help them figure out how to make more lasting changes.\u201d This year, she has focused especially on working with employees who continue to use tobacco.<\/p>\n<p>Every year, the company holds wellness contests, with varying rules and goals. Some have focused on losing weight and decreasing body fat, while others have focused on increasing time spent exercising.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">One competition awarded contestants points for every 15 minutes they spent exercising; for every serving of fruits or vegetables they ate; for every 8 ounces of water they consumed; and for every driving trip they took while wearing a seat belt. Points were also awarded for not eating red meat. Some contests involve teams, while others are individual. Prizes have included gift cards and up to $100 in cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This year, the company is holding a contest that runs from April to September. Every month, workers are eligible to earn entries into two separate drawings. One awards relatively small prizes such as gift cards. The other will give out a single, larger prize: an extra personal day. Boyd structured the contest so that every employee can participate.<\/p>\n<p>In April, as part of the contest, Boyd tested entrants on a range of strength and flexibility measures, including grip and biceps strength. Because metalwork involves a fair amount of upper body manual labor, workers at Creative Craftsmen generally scored high on strength measures. But the tests showed that many workers lacked flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, Boyd showed workers how to stretch. In September she will retest them to see whether they improved.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these contests, the company has a standing offer: a $100 bonus to any overweight or obese worker who loses weight and keeps it off for three months \u2014 or to any employee who quits smoking for six months.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Boyd also set up \u201clunch and learn\u201d sessions, in which a speaker talks to employees about a wellness topic.

style=\"font-size: 13px;\">By Teresa Pulvermacher, MSN, NP-C, Director of Program Development\/Operations Manager, Riverside Corporate Wellness<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The mission of Logistics Health Incorporated (LHI), in La Crosse, Wisconsin, is to \u201ctake care of the people we serve through innovative health care solutions.\u201d This starts at the roots, their own employees, because without roots, branches do not flourish and sprout leaves.<\/p>\n<p>Six years ago, Don Weber, founder and CEO of LHI, which helps their clients meet occupational health goals, began talking about planting the seeds of wellness and cultural landscaping to create a company-wide focus on health that could be transmitted to their clients.<\/p>\n<p>Weber piloted small-scale health and wellness initiatives, i.e., the seeds, such as a wellness committee to get a feel for what employees might appreciate, influenza immunization programs and weekly wellness tips, which have sprouted into a health in all policies approach to decisions and client services.<\/p>\n<p>LHI\u2019s offices are in the La Crosse Riverside Center, which is co-occupied by Riverside Corporate Wellness (RCW), an organization dedicated to promoting health and wellness through fitness, education programs and primary health.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, LHI has grown alongside their wellness partner, RCW, which has merged the pilot programs begun by Weber with an on-location primary care clinic at no cost to LHI employees and their families.<\/p>\n<p>The primary objective of LHI and RCW is what forces a continual cultural shift towards a healthier, more balanced life. The goals are clear: improve employee health habits; develop and maintain a recognized corporate culture of wellness; develop and maintain the Corporate-Advance Wellness Home Model; and ensure sustainability. More simply put, LHI advanced wellness because employees are the corporation\u2019s most valuable resource \u2014 a healthy employee and family is happier and more productive.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of merging an established and comprehensive wellness program with a clinical component is new and unique. The resulting services are specifically designed to meet employee and business needs\u2014they are convenient, accessible and comprehensive.<\/p>\n<p>In a business community, this kind of care maximizes opportunities for preventive care and health promotion, while reducing unnecessary reliance on specialized, urgent and emergency care.<\/p>\n<p>The most important factor is convenience. If employees can have their health care needs met in less than one hour on a consistent basis, rather than having to use hours of personal time to visit a provider, their productivity, absenteeism and adherence to doctor\/ practitioner recommendations and health will improve.<\/p>\n<p>LHI lives its company mission daily: always take care of the people they serve by providing innovative healthcare solutions that exceed expectations, are ethical and compassionate and fulfill the promises to employees, customers and communities. The combination of primary health services with a comprehensive wellness program, which includes frequent opportunities for health education, a readily accessible corporate fitness facility and specialized health risk programs, has transformed our sick care model into a true health care system, wherein we prevent disease from occurring rather than treating people after they become sick.<\/p>\n<p>That said, it doesn\u2019t happen overnight or with a snap of the fingers. Lifestyles that are more healthcare cost-efficient, satisfying and balanced, and that lead to wellness and good health are difficult changes to initiate and\/or maintain when financial resources are strained and other life issues take precedence. So we try to make it as easy as possible for employees. For example, employees and their families can access no-cost health promotion and primary care services at the workplace. A visit to the onsite primary health clinic is no longer just a visit for a sore throat; but an opportunity to address lifestyle and health promotion.<\/p>\n<p>Finding time for physical activity is no longer a burden, but a cultural workplace norm: employees can take paid time away from their desks to go to the gym or take a fitness class. In addition, primary care in the context of corporate wellness facilitates early detection and prevention of problems, even when there is not a heavy demand for such services involved in primary care. In every interaction with a health care provider, participation in wellness is carefully monitored and tracked. Extended visits to providers for traditional episodic care, and annual exams over an hour or longer, or even divided visits, afford the opportunity to address adherence to primary prevention strategies at all ages; well-infant and child exams; sports physicals; counseling on contraception, sexuality, drugs and alcohol for adolescents and young adults in the reproductive years; lifestyle management, nutrition and exercise in metabolic syndrome; and the prevention of diabetes and cancer. These visits provide time for assisted priority referrals to fitness coaching, alternative and integrative therapies, weight management, and tobacco cessation. Education regarding and access to recommended screening such as colonoscopy and mammography are coordinated and managed. Preventive care in this relaxed yet comprehensive environment has the potential to improve poor health, reduce risky behavior and address social and other determinants of health, as well as assisting parents in early childhood development.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional health care often presents numerous obstacles to continuity, access and convenience that impact the corporation. For example, clinic schedules require frequent attendance, a heavy cost in time, travel expenses and lost wages, which ultimately affect a patient\u2019s motivation to visit the provider. These\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">obstacles to care have been carefully considered in the scheduling of office visits at RCW Primary Health. To increase access and ensure a timely visit, we have taken a revolutionary approach. Visits to the provider can be scheduled over extended hours during the week with shortened waiting times. All clinic appointments are at a minimum of 30 minutes for episodic and acute care, and one hour for an annual exam, allowing the extra time for provider-member interaction and health education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Our alternative, convenience-focused approach to appointments is working\u2014serving a population of approximately 800 employees, the clinic has seen an average of 92 visits and nearly 80 unique members each week since its opening in February 2012. The model facilitates the improvement of the health of employees and their families, without any detriment to the operation or efficiency of the company. One employee recalls a recent visit to the onsite clinic: \u201cMy child was sick. I called, got in. I would have had to have taken four hours, if not the whole day off from work to have my child seen elsewhere.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>RCW has also engaged multiple corporate and community stakeholders in the implementation of this model. This includes previously underused communication technologies to ensure confidential exchange of health information to all local health providers that Riverside Center employees know and trust.<\/p>\n<p>Health care providers using electronic medical records over protected data lines, unaffiliated with LHI human capital, deliver effective and safe care with tools like the electronic medical record support prescribing systems and clinical decision aids. RCW and contracted providers are committed to developing new policies and communication methods.<\/p>\n<p>Community partners from local health systems and hospitals participate in the corporate model as contracted service providers that may include the professional staffing of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, behavioral health specialists, dietitians, purchasing, and clinical operations. All providers must support the practice model, mission and vision, and wellness philosophy of RCW and LHI. Third party providers also participate in information and data tracking technologies and other services essential to the operations such as cleaning, facility maintenance and laboratory services. There are tangible\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">benefits to both the service and practice model providers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The most unique component of the RCW and LHI comprehensive approach that has significantly affected workplace culture is compensated wellness time. As a matter of policy, LHI employees may use up to three hours of paid time per week to utilize all sponsored wellness activities. These hours do not incur overtime, and may be used in the corporate fully staffed fitness facility and personal training, or group exercise. Members may also attend educational lunches, tobacco cessation services, mobile screenings such as mammography, and appointment times in the clinic for themselves or a child. Employees may also participate in a supervised walking program, and a more independent yet highly structured running club. Additional paid time is allowed for attendance at an annual Health Expo, flu shot, and biometric screening event, and various community activities that fall under corporate sponsorship in the realm of social wellness, such as blood drives. These activities are carefully monitored and audited to maintain compliance with workplace rules and ensure accountability, while meeting business needs. Every hour is carefully tracked and categorized, and usage statistics are carefully maintained and detailed in a dashboard, which maintains data regarding biometrics, paid time off usage, worker\u2019s compensation, family medical leave, health care costs, days of hospitalization, sick days and unplanned paid time off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Routine culture audits, self-health reports and personal health assessment data, along with detailed dashboard data, allow RCW to draw significant conclusions about the health and wellness initiatives. Trending indicates that employees have improved or greatly improved participation in physical activity and lipid and glucose levels have normalized or remained normal for a significant portion of the population. We have also seen impact on the overweight population with a decrease in BMI for those with BMI in the 26 to 30 range. In addition, tobacco use is decreasing. Perhaps the most important cultural indicator is that ninety eight percent of LHI employees feel that LHI emphasizes wellness, and ninety nine percent rate wellness programming as good to excellent, with a participation or activation rate of up to eighty percent.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Don Weber is often quoted speaking eloquently about the cultural impact of wellness on not only the employee, but the family as well. \u201cMy dream is that every employee will be motivated by our corporate culture of wellness, and become a stronger and healthier part of the LHI family. In turn, I hope that our employees take that culture of wellness home with them at the end of the day and infuse it into their family lives.<\/p>\n<p>Healthy employees create healthier families, and ultimately, a healthier community for us all.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At RCW and LHI, we practice the 100\/0 rule that Dr. John Izzo, a behavior change consultant, proposes as a business principle\u2014and apply it to health and wellness\u2014one hundred percent responsibility, zero excuses. Excuses to not participate in wellness or health promotion and disease prevention activity may be legitimate, but when an employee of LHI takes one hundred percent responsibility, excuses are no longer useful\u2014and the cycle of inaction is broken. It is a very strong business concept that translates very well into wellness. The 100\/0 rule can work to positively change everything\u2014from health to personal relationships and business practices. RCW, LHI and Don Weber have taken responsibility for their employees at a level rarely seen in the corporate world and it has benefited employees, their family, the community and the bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>You can access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2013HealthierAmericaXrpt15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/planting-health-and-wellness-seeds-a-corporations-mission-to-help-their-employees-clients-and-the-bottom-line","date":"2013-02-12T19:46:44","modified":"2015-06-02T17:34:17","format":"standard","slug":"planting-health-and-wellness-seeds-a-corporations-mission-to-help-their-employees-clients-and-the-bottom-line","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4941","excerpt":"<p>By Teresa Pulvermacher, MSN, NP-C, Director of Program Development\/Operations Manager, Riverside Corporate Wellness &nbsp;

We know that by removing barriers to unhealthy lifestyles, we can reduce conditions such as obesity and diabetes that are plaguing our neighbors and driving up the cost of health care. In addition, the epidemic of physical inactivity and poor nutrition leads to chronic health problems like heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer.<\/p>\n<p>Our YMCA, through the Pioneering Healthier Communities (PHC) and many other initiatives is committed to improving the health and well-being of our community, both inside and outside the walls of the YMCA. We have been successful with our many community partners in combating the unhealthy lifestyles by implanting policies, projects and programs that make the healthy choice the easy choice where we live, learn, work and play.<\/p>\n<p>In the fall of 2007 our YMCA was selected by the YMCA of the USA to be a PHC YMCA. PHC is a partnership between the YMCA of the USA, local Y\u2019s, local businesses, local government and local organizations and CDC. This work provided the opportunity to bring community leaders together so collaboratively we could improve the health and well being of our community. Our success with the PHC initiative provided the platform to launch many other community focused health and well-being efforts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Play<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For years, YMCAs have focused on curbing physical inactivity. In fact, we\u2019ve found that a love of play at any age can really improve the health and wellbeing of kids of all ages and, by extension, our county.<\/p>\n<p>Three years ago we launched a program in partnership with YMCA of the USA called Press Play. Press Play is a free 8-week program designed to re-engage empty nester adults ages 45-60 in physical activity. Our Press Play opportunities have included basketball, dance, fitness classes, group exercise classes and nutrition.<\/p>\n<p>Two years ago we brought the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program to our community. The program helps those at high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles by eating healthier, increasing physical activity and losing a modest amount of weight in order to reduce their chances of developing the disease. Since April 2011, 100 individuals have enrolled in the YMCA\u2019s Diabetes Prevention Program at the La Crosse Area Family YMCA.<\/p>\n<p>At age 82, Dee Hutzler started exercising, lifting weights and changing her eating habits as part of the Diabetes Prevention Program. She joined the program when it was offered for the first time in April and lost 20 pounds during the first 16 weeks. She kept it off, even losing an additional five pounds during the maintenance period of the program. \u201cI am a lot healthier, and I feel stronger,\u201d Dee says. \u201cI move a lot better and I am making better choices when it comes to eating. I just didn\u2019t want to be diabetic, and when I heard about the program, I was really interested in it.\u201d Dee\u2019s story, as remarkable as it is, is a common occurrence among many participants of the YMCA\u2019s Diabetes Prevention Program since its launch in April, 2011.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, we built community gardens adjacent to our Community Teen Center and the childcare center at our North YMCA. We host garden tours for other childcare centers to help bring gardens to the rest of the community. All of the produce from our Y North garden is incorporated into snacks or provided to Y members.<\/p>\n<p>To reach younger populations, each year, through grant funding and a partnership with the Safe Kids coalition of the Coulee Region, the YMCA offers free swimming lessons. This year, over 130 youth between the ages of 6-14 spent a week in YMCA pools learning how to swim and be safe in the water.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Learn<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Healthier children and adolescents make healthier adults. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s far easier to educate younger people on healthy choices than curb entrenched lifestyle decisions in middle-age. To ensure our children have the brightest future possible, we need to make sure they are as healthy as they can be.<\/p>\n<p>One year ago we launched a partnership with the school district of Onalaska to manage their employee and student wellness programs. A \u201cCommunity Wellness Director\u201d spends half their time working with the district wellness team, the staff and the students within the district focused on improved well-being through behavior change. We have established a school garden at La Crosse\u2019s Franklin Elementary School. In addition, we have worked to incorporate farm-to-school curricula into the child care center and bring local fresh fruits and vegetables into school lunch menus. We have also transformed menus throughout the Y to include fresh fruits and vegetables for all children.<\/p>\n<p>This includes menu changes in our full time childcare center, our school age programs, summer school programs and at our community teen center. In fact, all 900 enrolled school age child care receive a fresh fruit or vegetable daily.<\/p>\n<p>To further educate children on the importance of a balanced diet, we are incorporating the 5210 curriculum into all Y youth programs: five fruits or vegetables daily, less than two hours of screen time, one hour of physical activity and zero sugary sweetened drinks daily. Slowly, we are seeing water become the drink of choice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People spend a lot of time at work. Unfortunately most of that time is sitting or, if they are moving\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">back and forth, it\u2019s usually to go to and from the vending machine. To truly affect a population change, we have to reach people where they are spending most of their time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, we partnered with a local vending company, Stansfield Vending, on Wellness Warriors, a program focused on increasing the amount of healthy food options in their vending machines.<\/p>\n<p>The healthy options are sold at a lower price point and the less healthy food items are at a higher price point. With the help of PHC, Wellness Warriors has been introduced to several local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Stansfield Vending launched another program countywide where for every piece of fresh fruit that is sold in their vending machines, they donate one piece of fresh fruit to the Ys School Age Child Care program.<\/p>\n<p>Through our PHC partners (Gundersen Lutheran Health System &amp; Mayo Health Systems), we created a Well Workplace Toolkit and recognition breakfast designed to encourage businesses to launch programs, policies and projects to support employee wellness within the workplace. We have also contracted with a large La Crosse employer, Inland Market and Labeling, to work with their wellness team to improve the well-being of their employees through behavior change efforts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where We Live<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The majority of our programs and initiatives are created to make it easier for people to make the healthy choice where they live. We have gone beyond our community center and delivered produce to schools, healthy vending options to workplaces and physical activity options to neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>Our PHC team recently brought together the leadership of local community gardens to have a conversation designed to bring efficiencies to the distribution of fruits and vegetables from these gardens. While we\u2019re in the early stages of this effort, ultimately it should improve access and distribution of fresh produce.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, in partnership with local businesses and the County of La Crosse, we have installed nearly 60 bike racks in the La Crosse community. The bike racks are located primarily downtown and help encourage the community to ride to town on bikes, not in cars.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2013HealthierAmericaXrpt16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/the-y-collaborating-for-a-stronger-healthier-and-happier-coulee-region","date":"2013-02-12T19:42:27","modified":"2015-06-02T18:01:10","format":"standard","slug":"the-y-collaborating-for-a-stronger-healthier-and-happier-coulee-region","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4939","excerpt":"<p>By Bill Soper, YMCA CEO La Crosse Area Family YMCA &nbsp; A stronger, healthier and happier Coulee Region starts with activities that keep residents active and engaged.

Janna Wilson, Senior External Relations Officer, Public Health \u2014 Seattle &amp; King County<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nationally and in Seattle and King County, health care reform is accelerating the work to better deliver both clinical services and population-based prevention, and there is much talk about the integration of public health and the health care delivery system. As we do this, however, we need to concurrently build out the third leg of this stool\u2014the integration of human services\u2014to more effectively tackle the underlying causes of poor health.<\/p>\n<p>In King County, some 79,000 additional people are expected to enter the Medicaid program in 2014, and another 117,000 people with low and moderate incomes will be eligible for tax credits and cost sharing assistance to encourage coverage under plans sold in the Exchange marketplace, Washington Healthplanfinder. While they are a varied group, their profile includes those who are expected to experience challenging social circumstances such as unemployment, housing problems, abusive relationships, substance abuse, or food instability \u2014 circumstances which in turn affect their health.<\/p>\n<p>Today, many of these uninsured low-income adults in King County connect with health and human service systems on an intermittent basis. They engage during times of need and crisis, and then may \u201cdrop out\u201d when the issues stabilize \u2014 too often only to find that those issues resurface later because the underlying conditions were not addressed. With health care reform, low-income residents are expected to have health care coverage that allows for on-going attachment to a \u201cmedical home,\u201d replacing what had been intermittent contact with a more stable, on-going connection. We\u2019re working to leverage this system change into a platform for providing more efficient, stable connections to human services. As local government \u2014 and a major funder of these services \u2014 we\u2019re in a good position to make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>As part of our pathway to accomplish this, we convened and continue to work with the King County Health Reform Planning Team, a group of representatives from across the health, behavioral health and human services fields, that emerged following the 2011 kick-off dialogue. They work with us to identify tactics that will drive more linkage and coordination between human services and the health care systems.<\/p>\n<p>We recently worked with our King County Executive and the King County Council on successful legislation that calls for the development of \u201ca plan for an accountable and integrated system of health, human services and community-based prevention in King County\u2026 in collaboration with the departments of public health and community and human services, and a community stakeholder panel informed by local and national expertise.\u201d The plan must include recommendations on investment strategies and financing options, a positive sign that local elected officials are engaged and recognize the larger benefits to our community\u2019s well-being that could be realized.<\/p>\n<p>Our efforts extend as well into the depths of the Medicaid program, where we are actively influencing Medicaid transformations being rolled out at the state level. When Washington State began its design of a managed care demonstration to integrate care for people dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare\u2014our poorest, most vulnerable residents with extensive human service needs and involvement\u2014county human service leaders advocated for a state legislative provision that assured the demonstration could only go forward in a geographic area with county government approved terms and conditions of participation.<\/p>\n<p>Because we share responsibility for the well-being of this population, the alignment between the state, the managed care organizations and local entities was important to us.<\/p>\n<p>In our County, we\u2019ve chosen to place ourselves right in the middle of this complex project. Quite\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">simply, for the demonstration project to achieve its goals, local human services expertise and relationships must be involved. In the latter half of 2012, King County\u2019s Department of Community\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">and Human Services, Public Health-Seattle &amp; King County, and our Area Agency on Aging worked with state Medicaid program staff to design the terms of our county\u2019s participation in the demonstration, with one of the critical provisions being a commitment to work together in an implementation team to share information, monitor impacts and make course corrections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We are also engaged with state Medicaid program partners and managed care plans in shaping the design and standards for \u201chealth home\u201d services, a provision under section 2703 of the Affordable Care Act that provides enhanced federal match levels for care management of Medicaid beneficiaries with chronic health conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Linkage to social services and health promotion are among the required services, and we believe it\u2019s here at the local level where we can best arrange for a systematic approach to making these connections, and negotiate with the payers who stand to benefit financially from the benefits of those services.<\/p>\n<p>Like many states, Washington is increasingly turning to managed care in the Medicaid program to advance integration as well as better manage costs. As managed care works to serve its growing volume of members with more complex social issues, our health department is already initiating contracts with them in our relevant areas of expertise, such as case management of children with highly complex health issues, and a post-hospital recuperation program for homeless adults. Through these activities, we are intersecting with the health care system and payers around what\u2019s most on their minds today \u2014 controlling costs while improving health\u2014to shape their roles in supporting that critical third leg of the stool, a robust and much-needed integration with human services.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Building community and political will for an integrated system of health, human services, and community-based prevention in King County, Washington<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>In 2011, at a community center in a suburb south of Seattle, over 120 representatives from the region\u2019s medical, behavioral health, public health, human services and local government systems kicked off a dialogue about\u00a0<\/em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">how to use the opportunities of health care reform to build a healthier King County.

Almost two-thirds of the 250,000 people who live in the city and the surrounding county are overweight or obese. In some neighborhoods, the rates are even higher.<\/p>\n<p>Ten years ago, the Mary Black Foundation, a private group based in Spartanburg, joined forces with local government and other local groups to confront this problem. The nonprofit foundation, which is dedicated to improving health in the area, decided to focus much of its attention on active living \u2014 the idea of helping people get more exercise in the course of daily life, rather than at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to ensure that our efforts are sustainable, and that we reach the most people in the most places, as often as possible,\u201d says Molly Talbot-Metz, director of programs at the Mary Black Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGyms are great, but you have to be able to afford them. And you need to have the time to actually go. With active living, it\u2019s built into your day.<\/p>\n<p>It creates a sustainable context for physical activity. We want being healthy and active to be easy, so that it becomes part of your lifestyle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Spartanburg, however, was not designed for active living. Like much of the country, the community is built to accommodate cars rather than people. In many places, there are no sidewalks; few streets have bike lanes. The neighborhoods where people live are often miles from where they work and shop. Many neighborhoods, especially\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">areas where poverty rates are high, have no grocery stores, making it difficult for people living there to buy healthy food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The foundation and its partners attacked the problem from multiple angles: they have increased opportunities for people to bicycle, walk, and do other kinds of exercise; expanded healthy food choices, especially for lower-income residents; and changed the larger policies that shape building and development in the city and county.<\/p>\n<p>The first focus was bicycling. In 2005, one of the foundation\u2019s partners, a local nonprofit called Palmetto Conservation Foundation, converted two miles of unused railroad track that ran through the city\u2019s center into a biking and walking trail. Another partner, Partners for Active Living (PAL), created a kind of bicycle library,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">which loans residents refurbished bikes, along with helmets and locks, for three months at a time; the group has a fleet of almost 250 bikes, and a waiting list for rentals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>PAL coordinated the installation of more than 150 bikes racks around the city, and later this year it will roll out a program that rents bicycles for a few hours, at a cost of a few dollars. And because many Spartanburg drivers aren\u2019t used to sharing the road, PAL sponsored a $25,000 media campaign \u2014 TV, radio, and street signs \u2014 to encourage\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">respect for bicyclists and pedestrians. Since 2005, the area has added more almost 30 miles of bike lanes, and more than 30 miles of bike and walking trails. The Mary Black Foundation has helped build support for the projects,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">and helped pay for some of the work. In 2007, the League of American Bicyclists named Spartanburg a \u201cBicycle-Friendly Community;\u201d it was the first city in the state to receive the award. The foundation has tried to get Spartanburg moving in other ways. It helped pay to rebuild a city recreation center in one of Spartanburg\u2019s\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">poorest neighborhoods, and to build a new YMCA from the ground up. Construction on that project has just begun. In recent years, the YMCA has focused on active living, and the centers in Spartanburg will work to include older\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">people and minorities, who tend to exercise less. In addition, the foundation helped build or refurbish seven playgrounds and parks around the county and city, in neighborhoods that lacked safe places for kids to play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The groups are also trying to encourage more Spartanburg students to walk. With funding from the foundation and support from PAL, three city public schools have started programs that encourage kids to walk to school at least once a week; next fall, three more schools will join the program.<\/p>\n<p>Food is another focus area for the foundation. Working with a nonprofit called Hub City Farmer\u2019s Markets, it started 40 community vegetable gardens, tended by local residents, and two weekly farmers\u2019 markets, one of which is located just off the rail trail. Every week, 30 or so farmers from Spartanburg County and other nearby counties<\/p>\n<p>sell fresh produce to an average of 650 customers. The Hub City group has bought an old ice cream truck and turned it into a mobile market that sells fresh fruits and vegetables: two days a week, it sets up in lower-income neighborhoods that lack access to supermarkets. Last year, the truck added bikes to its weekly menu: it began hauling a flatbed trailer filled with PAL\u2019s rental bikes. In part because of this partnership, most bike renters<\/p>\n<p>are lower-income people who don\u2019t have cars. Spartanburg is trying more innovative strategies too. In 2005, The Mary Black Foundation gave the Palmetto Conservation Foundation more than half a million dollars to start the Glendale Outdoor Leadership School (GOLS). Housed in a 161-year-old former Methodist church in a small mill town outside Spartanburg, the school teaches rock climbing, mountain biking, canoeing and kayaking to anyone who\u2019s interested, including children and seniors.<\/p>\n<p>Spartanburg\u2019s strategy differs from that of many other groups dealing with obesity, said Talbot- Metz. Instead of spending years, and a lot of resources, thinking about how to attack the problem, the group got its projects off the\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">ground quickly. It began by looking for local groups to work with; when those groups didn\u2019t exist, it helped create them \u2014 PAL, for instance. The projects are having an effect, she said: \u201cThere\u2019s a buzz about active living in the community. More people are joining our mission.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For instance, Eric Turner, the owner of Bike Worx, a local bike store, relocated his shop last year from a strip mall outside the city to one end of the rail trail. On weekends, about half of his customers arrive via the trail.<\/p>\n<p>This year, he used half of a $25,000 grant from the Mary Black Foundation to build trails in a city park. With volunteers, including an expert trail builder, Turner created a 5.5-mile network of biking and walking paths, which would typically have cost more than $100,000. With the other half of the grant, Turner bought kids\u2019\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">bikes for the leadership school to use in outdoor adventure camps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even with all their work, the foundation and its partners realize they have a long way to go. The rail trail could accommodate twice as much traffic as it now gets, and some residents don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there; to fix this, PAL will increase marketing and promotion. And although the trail is patrolled by police on bikes, and has never had a reported robbery or violent crime, some residents worry about safety. To ease concerns, PAL plans to install cameras and call boxes along the paths.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the foundation has invested more than $6 million on active living; it has no plans to stop.

Initiative began in Northwest Mississippi in the late 1990s. As NBCUSA churches worked to include health and wellness in worship, they found that, while people liked the idea of improving health, they didn\u2019t know what to do. So, in 2002, the UF created a health and wellness observers calendar. Pulling information from Healthy People 2000 and other public health research organizations, the calendar was fashioned to include monthly observances.<\/p>\n<p>It worked fairly well the first year, but usage took off in the second year. In the second iteration of the calendar, they added more options and ways for people to make healthy choices.<\/p>\n<p>Next, the UF created a companion guide to go along with the calendar. Both pieces provide easy-to-understand tips on how to incorporate health into worship and daily lives. For example, September includes Sickle Cell Sabbath and November includes Diabetes ID (I Decide) Day.<\/p>\n<p>The signature event of the calendar and guide is Taste Test Sunday, focused on diabetic safe desserts. The event includes a blind taste test of desserts made with and without sugar. Organizers found that men in the congregation couldn\u2019t tell the difference and even preferred the diabetic safe desserts. In the past year, other diabetic safe foods have been to the taste test and have proved popular. Along with the calendar and guide, the NBC created the What\u2019s Cooking? Initiative with the American Diabetes Association aimed at promoting healthy ingredients in meals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No Fry Zones<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition, some Baptist churches have created \u201cno fry\u201d zones in their congregations. One church in Mississippi resisted the change initially but eventually made the switch thanks to the leadership of their pastor.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Michael Minor, a special health assistant to the president of the National Baptist Congress, said the idea of the no fry zone was a way to get his foot in the door, talk about health and wellness and demonstrate how the church could take a stand. He viewed the fry ban as similar to when churches stopped using wine for communion to help congregants with alcohol issues. \u201cWe are trying to work with people who have health challenges and keep others from having those challenges,\u201d Dr. Minor said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Using Church and Community Grounds to Benefit Health and Wellness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Church and Community Garden Project promotes the development of gardens to increase access to and consumption of fruits and vegetables. It has the added bonus of helping congregants become physically active through gardening and allowing for shared use of the land for exercise and play.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some congregants wanted to walk around church grounds, so ministers have been encouraged to measure off distances so congregants can track how far they are walking. Some ministers have gone so far as to create paths linking churches, grounds and cemeteries to ensure congregants have safe places to walk and exercise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe bottom line is we need to spend more time focused on reaching a common ground and making lives better,\u201d said Dr. Minor. \u201cWe can all rally around health to make our community better. Who wouldn\u2019t want a healthier nation?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health Ambassadors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After the NBC published the calendar and the guide, congregants began exploring ways to benefit their communities as a whole. That sparked the creation of health ambassadors, representatives of each church that are trained as health promoters. In addition, the NBC created the \u201cFirst Ladies for the First Lady,\u201d a group of local church first ladies advocating on behalf of <em>Let\u2019s Move!<\/em>. To mark the two-year anniversary of <em>Let\u2019s Move!<\/em>, First Lady Michelle Obama spoke at Northland Church in Longwood, Florida and asked the National Baptist Convention to train and deploy 10,000 health ambassadors in 10,000 churches by September 2012. By the end of April, 2012, NBCUSA state and district affiliates representing more than 3,000 churches have committed to this training.<\/p>\n<p>To access a PDF of the story, click <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/national%20baptist.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/h-o-p-e-initiative-and-the-national-baptist-convention","date":"2013-02-02T20:53:05","modified":"2013-02-22T20:55:51","format":"standard","slug":"h-o-p-e-initiative-and-the-national-baptist-convention","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4960","excerpt":"<p>The National Baptist Convention USA (NBCUSA), incorporated through its Congress of Christian Education, is committed to ensuring all National Baptist churches have health and wellness ministries.

However, through Community Food Systems work, we have broadened that goal to ensure our local food system encompasses all members of the community (rural and urban) and has public health and prevention as a priority. This shift has coincided with the local food movement.<\/p>\n<p>In Dane County, which includes Madison, Wisconsin, we are lucky to have a diverse agriculture system. Along with conventional row crop farming, we have many fruit and vegetable farms, Community Supported Agriculture farms, and livestock and dairy farms. We also have multiple farmers markets and in fact, our Dane County Farmer\u2019s Market is the largest producer only market in the country.<\/p>\n<p>Still, when we took a step back and looked at the entire community, we realized not everyone had access to fresh, locally grown food. Solving this type of disparity became a priority and many members of the community, including local government, took up the issue. Some of the most notable improvements have been the development of school and community gardens, implementation of farm to school programs and the expansion of farmers markets.<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to provide place-based education, Dane County UW-Extension nutrition educators set-up displays at farmers markets to talk to people about what produce is in-season and inexpensive and to provide cooking demonstrations.<\/p>\n<p>Often, we find that people are interested in using fresh ingredients but thought they were too expensive or didn\u2019t know how to prepare them. The nutrition educators are often stationed at markets near public health clinics and help people understand that they can use their Women, Infant and Children (WIC) coupons and EBT card for food benefits at the farmers market.<\/p>\n<p>Extension also works closely with schools and other organizations to help create and maintain school gardens. We use school gardens as classrooms to teach students about gardening, nutrition and other important life skills. Our goal is to have a garden at every school in the county. Extension staff were founding members of the GROW Coalition that supports school and parent organizations that are interested in outdoor education with a strong emphasis on nutrition and getting kids outside and active.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2005 the Dane County Food Council, a committee of citizens and County Board Supervisors, has led the mission to explore issues and develop recommendations to create an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable local food system for Dane County. They have advocated for policies and supported the development of programs within the county such as the Institutional Food Marketing (IFM) Coalition. The Coalition started in 2006 to link farmers with schools, hospitals and other institutions to help them source local food. We found many organizations want to purchase locally grown food, however they didn\u2019t have the channels to do so efficiently. IFM connects farmers with the institutions, improving the farmer\u2019s business and the health of the community members these organizations employ, teach and serve. To our knowledge, this is the only County operated coalition of its kind that exists in the United States and it has had tremendous success. IFM generated more than $1.5 million in local wholesale food sales in 2010 helping to create or retain 29 jobs in the area.<\/p>\n<p>We are also working to address barriers in the community food system that have been identified including lack of infrastructure and farmer access to land. One of these new projects is the development of a food hub (produce packing house) where locally grown produce can be aggregated, packed and sold to local distributors and institutions. We are also working with the Dane County Parks Department on ways to make county owned land available to beginning farmers to raise food.<\/p>\n<p>In Dane County, we are working to help every member of the community stay healthy and be active, so our community can thrive. By engaging with people at various levels, we ensure healthy foods and information is available to all who want to live healthier and more active lives.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of this story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2012InvstgAmrcsHlthDaneCnty.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/dane-county-linking-our-local-food-system-with-the-health-of-our-community","date":"2013-02-02T19:39:44","modified":"2015-06-02T17:55:07","format":"standard","slug":"dane-county-linking-our-local-food-system-with-the-health-of-our-community","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4937","excerpt":"<p>By Carrie Edgar, Department Head and Community Food Systems Educator, Dane County UW Extension &nbsp; Dane County UW-Extension has a long history of working with the farmers who raise our food and the consumers who purchase it.

Randy Butler, CEO of the Dyer County, Tennessee, YMCA<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>DYERSBURG IS LIKE A LOT OF SMALL TOWNS IN AMERICA. MOST PEOPLE MAKE A LIVING BY \u00a0ARMING OR WORKING IN FACTORIES, AND WE\u2019RE SMALL ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE STILL SAY HELLO ON THE STREET AND WAVE TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY DRIVE BY. OVERALL, WE\u2019RE NOT A WEALTHY PLACE, BUT WE\u2019RE NOT POOR EITHER.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And somewhere over the past 30 years, a lot of us here gained much too much weight.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, we ate too much and moved too little. Our children watched too much TV, played too many video games, and ate too many french fries and not enough greens. To give you an idea of where things stand: Tennessee is the third fattest state in the country, and Dyer County is one of the least healthy, most overweight counties in the state. More than a third of adults in the county are obese, and almost half of the kids are obese or overweight.<\/p>\n<p>Now we\u2019re trying to do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, the Dyer County YMCA won a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to fight obesity in Dyer County and Dyersburg.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m the head of the Dyer County YMCA, and I\u2019m in charge of the project. We\u2019re not a large operation, and I have a lot on my plate. I have a total of three full-time employees at the Y, so, for example, when the basement of our rec center flooded this spring, I was down there mopping up.<\/p>\n<p>But luckily, in a small town people know each other, and we\u2019re used to cooperating. One of the first things we did was get together a committee of more than 20 town leaders \u2014 everybody from bank presidents to church pastors to hospital administrators to middle school PE teachers. We realize that obesity is everybody\u2019s problem.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of this is new to us. A few months ago, a couple of us went to Salt Lake City for a conference on active living and obesity. Salt Lake City is a big bicycling city, and I have to admit that seeing so many bicycles on the streets looked a little strange to me. It just wasn\u2019t something I was used to. But at the same time, that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing for in Dyersburg \u2014 more bike lanes, more biking.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a big believer in the do-it-yourself method: Just get started. The community turned an abandoned lumberyard into a farmer\u2019s market. An alderman and a couple of private citizens donated some of their unused land for community gardens. We\u2019ve got four gardens going now.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve focused on kids, because once you\u2019re an adult, it\u2019s much harder to lose extra weight. A lot of times, it\u2019s not kids\u2019 fault that they\u2019re overweight. If their parents, schools and communities feed them the wrong foods and don\u2019t encourage them to exercise, we can\u2019t be surprised when they end up weighing too much.<\/p>\n<p>Parents and communities have to be more involved than they were in the past. I\u2019m 42, and when I was growing up near Atlanta, we\u2019d go outside on a Saturday morning, we\u2019d spend the day running around, and we wouldn\u2019t come home until dusk.<\/p>\n<p>Society is different now, and a lot of parents don\u2019t allow their kids to do that anymore. So we have to do more to make sure kids get the activity they need.<\/p>\n<p>I love football and baseball, but we want to reach the kids who aren\u2019t playing team sports too. You can lose weight with all kinds of activities. For instance, one of our elementary schools began an aerobics class once a week during school. A teacher at a city intermediate school started the \u201cMorning Mile Club,\u201d where students walk around the track before classes. The kids started tracking how many miles they walked, which got them excited about what they were doing. Now, on sunny days you can see 100 kids out there walking. One student walked 26 miles in just a few weeks. Teachers tell me that they can tell which days the kids are walking because their behavior is better during class.<\/p>\n<p>We also started a contest with all of our 3rd, 4th and 5<sup>th<\/sup> graders. Students keep track of how much exercise they get after school; the class that moves the most wins prizes. The kids tell their parents \u2018I have to go outside and play.\u2019 Everybody in the family starts to realize that daily exercise is really important.<\/p>\n<p>Our cafeterias are also changing. We now give students only fresh fruit snacks \u2014 no more cupcakes and candy in our city primary school.<\/p>\n<p>And of course the Y can help too. My favorite example one of our teens who got a membership, started working out and taking classes, and lost close to 100 pounds. It was great to see how his confidence grew. He\u2019d always been withdrawn, but as he lost weight, he really began coming out of his shell.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re a rural area, and we have a lot of open space, which has some beautiful walking and hiking trails running through it. But right now, not enough people use these trails. We\u2019re trying to connect these trails to the places that people live so they can just walk out their door and start moving. Dyersburg is 20 miles from the Mississippi River, and we\u2019ve been talking about creating a blueway there, a designated water trail for canoeists and kayakers. Paddling definitely counts as exercise. We know we have a lot more to do. We didn\u2019t become fat overnight. It might take 15 or 20 years to fix this problem. Maybe if we keep at it, we\u2019ll end up like Salt Lake City, with our downtown streets painted with bike lanes, and packs of bikers pedaling to work every day. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s something I could get used to.<\/p>\n<p>Access the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/dyersburg,%20Tenn.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/dyersburg-makes-a-push-against-obesity","date":"2013-02-02T18:51:54","modified":"2015-06-02T17:55:14","format":"standard","slug":"dyersburg-makes-a-push-against-obesity","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4912","excerpt":"<p>By Randy Butler, CEO of the Dyer County, Tennessee, YMCA &nbsp; DYERSBURG IS LIKE A LOT OF SMALL TOWNS IN AMERICA.

staying healthy\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">and taking care of their bodies is an aspect of respecting their faith, making healthy living part of their heritage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Three years ago, the JCC Association partnered with the University of Texas School of Public Health and its Coordinated Approach to Child Health (CATCH) Program. Together, they created Discover: CATCH Early Childhood, a child wellness program aimed at encouraging healthy habits in the youngest members of the community and their families.<\/p>\n<p>JCC Association\u2019s version of Discover: CATCH is based on a foundation of Jewish values. The evidence-<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">based model that CATCH has pioneered attempts to instill an appreciation for physical activity in children ages 3 to 5 and encourages them to develop life-long healthy eating habits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As part of the program, children learn to have fun while exercising. They are also taught to differentiate between \u201cgo\u201d foods, which are good for them and \u201cwhoa\u201d foods that are less healthy.<\/p>\n<p>The program is focused on young children, but it seeks to engage the adults in their lives, including parents and educators. The JCC Association has created a series of parent tip sheets to bring lessons<\/p>\n<p>home and help the entire family think more carefully about food, nutrition and exercise. The model positions JCCs as a wellness provider to the community. JCCs have been able to reach families with older children as well by incorporating Discover: CATCH into teen after-school programs.<\/p>\n<p>While the Discover: CATCH program is just finishing the final stages of the pilot phase, the responses across the board have been positive. Based on surveys sent to members before and after the program began, there has been a cultural shift in the way early childhood classes are being taught. For instance, young children no longer play \u201celimination games\u201d (such as Duck, Duck, Goose) where a large portion of children are not participating at any given time. Children are also growing their own fruits and vegetables for snacks.<\/p>\n<p>The pilot communities are also seeing a change in how early childhood educators and staff work with parents. Parents are sending healthier foods with their children and asking schools to serve healthier foods. Encouraged by these results, JCC Association added an education piece on farming and farm-to-table initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>In November 2010, JCC Association started \u201cJCC Grows\u201d to encourage JCCs to establish gardens and encourage members to support fresh food projects and be physically active. A significant portion of the harvests from the gardens are donated to local food pantries. The JCC Movement also has one of the largest networks of day and resident camps in North America. Since starting their partnership with Discover: CATCH, camps have gotten rid of the old \u201cbug juice and greasy grilled cheese\u201d in favor of healthier food, some of which comes from their own gardens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health and Wellness at Local JCCs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Shaw Jewish Community Center <\/strong>in Akron, Ohio held a Discover: CATCH Wellness Fair on January 22, 2012. More than 1,000 people took part and learned about all different aspects of health and wellness. Discover: CATCH was a natural complement to the Shaw JCC\u2019s Ethical Start Early Childhood<\/p>\n<p>Program. According to Lisa Pesantez, who teaches a group of two-year olds and a class of third-, fourth- and fifth-graders, \u201cFor my [two-year olds] I think the biggest thing has been showing them that exercising can be fun! I believe that the purpose is to give wholeness and completeness to physical activity, spirituality, and nutrition for both the students and the teachers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Asheville Jewish Community <\/strong>Center in North Carolina took the JCC Grows initiative and created an entire Jewish Children\u2019s Garden Curriculum. They started by forming a volunteer committee of parents and interested teaching staff with garden design, art therapy and Judaic experience. The Asheville JCC is in a busy downtown area with just two narrow grassy areas (one 20\u2019 x 70\u2019 and the other 20\u2019 x 25\u2019) which became their children\u2019s garden. The community helped fund the garden through a Children\u2019s Garden Legacy Campaign, which offered naming opportunities for each section. The JCC also solicited volunteers to help build the garden, including a teen youth group, preschool teachers, parents, landscapers, gardeners, and many others. The garden provides healthy foods for the entire community and educational opportunities for children.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the example <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/JCC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/the-jewish-community-center-associations-discover-catch-early-childhood-program","date":"2013-02-01T20:48:21","modified":"2015-06-02T17:33:54","format":"standard","slug":"the-jewish-community-center-associations-discover-catch-early-childhood-program","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4957","excerpt":"<p>To tackle obesity, the Jewish Community Center (JCC) Association focused on one simple\u00a0premise: it\u2019s much easier to create good health habits than it is to change bad ones.

In the last two years, the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District (Metro Health) through the Communities Putting Prevention\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">to Work grant has created around 30 initiatives that help make the healthy choice the easier choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We increased access to healthy foods and opportunities for physical activity, and we\u2019ve worked on changing the built environment so that parks and community and residential areas are supportive of\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">a healthy lifestyle. We recently passed a Complete Streets ordinance that requires new city-sponsored streets to provide support for bikes and pedestrians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We have also partnered with city departments, such as the Library, the Planning Department, Public Works, the Office of Environmental Policy, and the Parks Department to improve health.<\/p>\n<p>Through the Parks Department, \u201cFitness in the Park\u201d provides free classes to city residents, including Yoga, Zumba, boot camps and other exercise classes. In addition, we placed outdoor fitness stations in 25 parks. When the National Recreation and Parks Association came to view our program, San Antonians went up and thanked them, thinking they had provided the resources \u2013 our community was that appreciative of the fitness stations. Since we installed the outdoor fitness stations, park use has gone up.<\/p>\n<p>With the local Independent School Districts, we\u2019ve put 108 salad bars in schools, which reach 100,000 students. We\u2019ve provided physical activity equipment to 365 schools to ensure 350,000 students are moving, active, and understand the importance of healthy behaviors. We have also placed health assessment stations, outdoor fitness equipment and walking trails on the grounds of local libraries. Families can enjoy both reading and physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, San Antonio became the first city in Texas to have a Bike Share program thanks to collaboration between Metro Health and the Office of Environmental Policy. Now, Austin and Houston are modeling similar initiatives after ours. We established a Ride-to-Own bicycle program which has flourished in underserved communities and provided over 1200 bicycles to residents.<\/p>\n<p>By working with the Mayor\u2019s office and other city departments, we\u2019ve made health a community movement. Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro established a Mayor\u2019s Fitness Council and has heavily promoted these initiatives. This gives our programs more community support and awareness.<\/p>\n<p>The community spirit is evident during S\u00edclov\u00eda, a free event that temporarily makes selected San Antonio streets available to residents for recreational and sports activities so participants can bike, run, skateboard, etc. without worrying about cars.<\/p>\n<p>Because our first S\u00edclov\u00eda was so popular, we were approached by Fiesta San Antonio to incorporate a health focus. Fiesta is the city\u2019s week-long celebration each year with festivals, parades and numerous activities.<\/p>\n<p>We are launching a \u201cFit Fiesta\u201d to allow people access to healthy activities and foods. While this is a small step, it is an encouraging move toward making one of our biggest community gatherings healthier. S\u00edclov\u00eda will be a pre-Fiesta event to kick off a Fit Fiesta.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve found that if we provide the community with ways to be healthy and exercise, they will enthusiastically use these resources. While we\u2019ve had great accomplishments, we need to keep up the momentum.<\/p>\n<p>This is a start, it is incredibly important to change the attitude of residents to give them opportunities. If they have few options, they are more likely to stay inside \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that.

It quickly became how we were brought up.<\/p>\n<p>I coach basketball and can easily secure a gym for practice.

This goes way beyond gyms to include any fields, trails and most other grounds.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, most of our schools have trail systems that connect through the neighborhoods, which can\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">be used for hiking, biking and running.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Quite simply, our community tries to get everything they can out of the land and it really does help people get physically active.<\/p>\n<p>With the shared use policies, it\u2019s also been far easier to make additional investments in school facilities. Private individuals have paired with public funding to supplement what schools have \u2014 anything from infield dirt for a baseball diamond to additional resources for trails. The land serves all capacities \u2014 the school invests in it and the community invests in it.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, we\u2019ve extended the nature of shared use to parks. We even developed a centrally located district park that serves as a hub for the community \u2014 it is near schools, our greenhouse facilities, the animal shelter, our farmer\u2019s market, the recycling center and the senior\u2019s center.<\/p>\n<p>We have been able to create connectivity between all activities \u2014 so instead of just dropping of recycling, residents also visit the market or take a hike around the connecting trails.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the farmer\u2019s market is right by one of the trails that is over a mile long and runs around the park. It is also adjacent to the community garden. When we planned to open the garden, which is one and one quarter acres, we had a waiting list for folks that wanted their own plot of land. There was huge excitement and that has continued to this day. A resident who moved here from North Dakota was one of the first people in line for the community garden. She never expected the level of community camaraderie among the gardeners. She gets good exercise and grows healthy foods to serve her family.<\/p>\n<p>The gardeners come down to walk on the trail, meet a relative or neighbor \u2014 it has created a nice family and intergenerational atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, our senior center residents use the garden to help educate elementary school kids about gardening and kindergarten classes have lessons there. In fact, they had their own jambalaya cooking project at the height of the growing season.<\/p>\n<p>The kids really enjoyed themselves, but also were introduced to healthy vegetables and foods that are grown in their community. We know we aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 we constantly need to work to help people stay healthy and happy, and, to that end, we\u2019ve expanding our reach to corner stores in food deserts to market fruits and vegetables prominently.<\/p>\n<p>For us, it all started with the shared use policy in 1978. Since then, the community has bought into a healthy lifestyle and we\u2019ve been able to do more and more to help more and more people stay fit, active and productive.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2012InvstgAmrcsHlthPitt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/pitt-county-celebrating-our-community-and-our-communitys-wellness","date":"2012-03-22T17:31:27","modified":"2013-02-22T17:33:48","format":"standard","slug":"pitt-county-celebrating-our-community-and-our-communitys-wellness","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4892","excerpt":"<p>By James Rhodes, Planning Director, Pitt County, North Carolina &nbsp; People talk about prevention initiatives such as shared use policies and farmers markets as if they are new and maybe they are for them.

Additionally, a community survey conducted by ETC Leisure Vision found greenways and trail development was an important and unmet need for the majority of Mecklenburg County residents.<\/p>\n<p>The results of the 2008 Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation Master Plan clearly reveal the public\u2019s appreciation for natural areas and their desire for a trail system.<\/p>\n<p>Survey results indicate County residents understand and support the role of greenways as both corridors for environmental protection and potential trail development. Ninety-three percent of all residents felt the role of greenways as a connected network of walking, biking and nature trails was very important<\/p>\n<p><strong>Connecting people and places<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mecklenburg County currently has 37 miles of developed and 150 miles of undeveloped greenways. The most notable being the Little Sugar Creek Greenway which stretches through the heart of Charlotte.<\/p>\n<p>When complete, the greenway will feature over 19 miles of trails and land connectors, from Toby Creek Greenway on North Tryon Street to Cordelia Park just north of uptown. The greenway will continue through the urban section and on to the South Carolina state line, conveniently linking Central Piedmont Community College, Carolina Healthcare System and the Park Road and Carolina Place shopping areas among many other destinations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Federal Support<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2009, Park and Recreation received $2.35 million in federal stimulus funding for the construction of Toby Creek Greenway in the University City area and West Branch Rocky River Greenway in Davidson.<\/p>\n<p>The funding was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and obtained through the Mecklenburg Union County Metropolitan Planning Organization (MUMPO) through a competitive ranking process. Originally, the two projects were supposed to receive funding with 2004 Park and Recreation bonds that the County never issued due to the economic downturn.<\/p>\n<p>Toby Creek Greenway and West Branch Rocky River Greenway will add to the Carolina Thread Trail greenway network which will eventually extend over 500 miles into 15 counties and to 2 million people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBoth West Branch Rocky River Greenway and Toby Creek Greenway add important sections to our overall greenway system,\u201d said Park and Recreation Greenway Planner Gwen Cook.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWithout the funding, neither project would be possible.\u201d The impact of the stimulus money has enabled Park and Recreation\u2019s greenway division to continue carrying out its mission of providing natural transportation and fitness areas that help to improve water quality, reduce the impacts of flooding,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">and provide wildlife habitat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Improving the public\u2019s health<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A region\u2019s trail network will contribute to the overall health of residents by offering people attractive, safe, accessible places to bike, walk, hike, jog, skate, and possibly places to enjoy water-based trails. In short, the trail network will create better opportunities for active lifestyles. The design of communities\u2014including towns, subdivisions, transportation systems, parks, trails and other public recreational facilities\u2014affects people\u2019s ability to reach the recommended 30 minutes each day of moderately intense physical activity (60 minutes for youth).<\/p>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \u201cPhysical inactivity causes numerous physical and mental health problems, is responsible for an estimated 200,000 deaths per year, and contributes to the obesity epidemic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In identifying a solution, the CDC determined that by creating and improving places in our communities to be physically active, there could be a 25 percent increase in the percentage of people who exercise at least three times a week. This is significant considering that for people who are inactive, even small increases in physical activity can bring measurable health benefits. Additionally, as people become more physically active outdoors, they make connections with their neighbors that contribute to the health of their community.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0Access a PDF of the example <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2012InvstgAmrcsHlthGreenway.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The above was provided by Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation.<\/em><\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/go-the-greenway-mecklenburg-county-north-carolina","date":"2012-03-22T17:28:06","modified":"2015-06-02T17:38:50","format":"standard","slug":"go-the-greenway-mecklenburg-county-north-carolina","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4889","excerpt":"<p>There is a clear public need and desire for greenways and trail development in Mecklenburg County.

But the trails didn\u2019t connect to downtown or most neighborhoods, and they only traveled north and south, which left out residents who lived on the east or west sides.<\/p>\n<p>As it studied the issue, LWO realized that the city and its surrounding suburbs were not designed to encourage physical activity. \u201cHere in Omaha, we have engineered healthy living out of our environment,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cWe\u2019ve only built for the automobile.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nebraska\u2019s largest city, Omaha, has a population of 410,000. Its geography is determined largely by the automobile: sprawling sidewalk-less suburbs surround the city, malls and big-box stores provide much of the shopping, and fast-food restaurants dot many street corners. Ironically, Peterson said, the area\u2019s relative lack of traffic and gridlock encourages a sedentary lifestyle. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to get around,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting in your car is the easiest choice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Over the past six years, LWO and its partners \u2014 local governments as well as area health and civic groups \u2014 have worked to change this landscape in Omaha and surrounding Douglas County. They have moved beyond bicycling,<\/p>\n<p>and are now trying to increase the city\u2019s level of walking, exercise, and healthy eating. These efforts got a major boost last year, when the CDC gave LWO and the Douglas County Health Department a two-year, $5.7 million grant to encourage healthy eating and active living.<\/p>\n<p>LWO has focused much of its work on bicycling. At first, not everyone was receptive. In 2003, the group approached the city planning department about the possibility of a network of bike lanes on Omaha\u2019s streets. The planners told Peterson that their job was limited to moving automobiles.<\/p>\n<p>But the group persisted, and the planning officials came around. In 2008, the city began creating 20 miles of on-street bike lanes to make riding downtown safer and easier for commuters.<\/p>\n<p>The money for the work, $600,000, came from a local charity and an anonymous donor. Almost all the bike lanes are on streets; many follow former street-car routes, because these streets were already wider to accommodate the tracks. LWO is now working with the city to add more lanes. In addition, the group has helped Omaha\u2019s transit agency outfit buses with bike racks, so people can ride for part of their commute, or get from their home to a trail.<\/p>\n<p>Another local group, Activate Omaha, designed and printed 5,000 maps to highlight the city\u2019s best streets for bicycling. The maps were distributed to bike shops, libraries and other public places. The group, which receives much of its funding from LWO, started an urban adventure bike race. Every spring for the past three years,<\/p>\n<p>350 or so participants pedal around the city chasing clues from spot to spot.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, both groups convinced the city to start a Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee. Last year, the city hired its first bicycle and pedestrian coordinator. This spring, to encourage drivers to respect pedalers, LWO rolled out a $250,000 \u201cIRide\u201d media campaign featuring radio ads, social media, and signs at city and county DMV offices.<\/p>\n<p>Peterson doesn\u2019t blame Omaha drivers for their lack of understanding: \u201cThey\u2019ve never had a large number of people biking in the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LWO and its partners have also focused on making it easier for residents to buy healthy food. On the city\u2019s east and west sides, several lowerincome areas have no supermarkets, and many residents rely on convenience stores and corner markets for most of their shopping. Using just over a third of the CDC grant, LWO and its partners have attacked this problem.<\/p>\n<p>First, the Douglas County Health Department surveyed all 385 food retailers in the city \u2014 everything from corner stores to supermarkets. Each outlet received a rating, which depended largely on the amount of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other healthy items. After integrating this data with information about each neighborhood\u2019s income,<\/p>\n<p>fruit and vegetable consumption, and obesity rate, the researchers identified the three neighborhoods that most needed healthier food.<\/p>\n<p>The program is now working with eight stores in these areas to increase their selection of healthy food, and pays up to $2,500 for the infrastructure \u2014 bins, refrigeration etc. \u2014 to store and display this food. By offering to spruce up<\/p>\n<p>stores, the health department succeeded in getting owners and managers interested. \u201cIf we\u2019d just come in and said we want to enhance your nutritional profile,\u2019 no one would have been interested,\u201d said Mary Balluff, who oversees the program for the city.<\/p>\n<p>County agricultural extension officers also visit the stores to give training and advice on subjects such as how best to display vegetables and fruits. This isn\u2019t as simple as it might seem: for instance, bananas can\u2019t be placed next to apples and other fruits because the apples give off a gas that spoils the bananas.<\/p>\n<p>Activate Omaha recently began working with city schools. This spring, Omaha schools will plant 10 school gardens. And 26 Omaha area schools, most of them in the city, have joined a Safe Routes to School program. At some schools, kids walk with parents or teachers a few times a month; at others they walk almost every day. Julie Harris, who coordinates the program for Activate Omaha, said the group hopes to add more schools, and increase involvement at schools that are already participating. The projects are funded by several public and private groups, including CDC, RWJF, and local charities.<\/p>\n<p>LWO has more projects in the works. This summer, Peterson hopes to add a mobile farmer\u2019s market: a converted snack or ice cream truck that stops at downtown offices during the week, selling fresh fruits and vegetables. The city already has four large farmer\u2019s markets, but they are only open on Saturdays and Sundays.<\/p>\n<p>And she wants to keep adding bike lanes; she hopes to at least double the mileage.<\/p>\n<p>The work is getting easier, she said: \u201cIn 2002, we were the only ones working on this. Now there are so many groups. It\u2019s gone a lot faster than we anticipated.

The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) received $6.1 million to reduce Boston residents use and exposure to tobacco.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Over the past two years, this funding has been used to support a robust campaign to implement smoke-free policies throughout the city, including in public and private housing, on hospital campuses and on all public school properties.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, BPHC, in partnership with private developers and city development agencies, set out to create 1,000 new smoke-free housing units by providing technical assistance, free advertising and other incentives to building owners.<\/p>\n<p>The city has now far-exceeded its goal, with over 4,000 units logged in the last two years. In addition, the Boston Housing Authority will convert its 12,000 units to be smoke-free, improving indoor air quality for the housing authority\u2019s 27,000 residents and 900 employees.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond indoor air policies, the city has implemented policies to improve outdoor air quality in targeted environments. This past summer, the Parks Department posted No Smoking signs at all 135 city-owned playgrounds, urging parents and park users to think twice before lighting up around young children.<\/p>\n<p>And this fall, the Mayor stood with the city\u2019s teaching hospitals to announce a plan to make city hospital campuses smoke free. When fully implemented in April 2012, these policies will eliminate secondhand smoke exposure during over 5 million patient visits and for over 50,000 employees.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHospitals are places where sick people go for healing,\u201d said Dr. Paula A. Johnson, a cardiologist who is executive director of the Connors Center for Women\u2019s Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and chair of the Boston Public Health Commission\u2019s Board of Health. \u201cIt is critically important that hospitals create environments \u2014 not only inside the walls of the institutions, but also on their doorsteps \u2014that promote good health.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The city followed up the hospital announcement with a vote of the Boston School Committee, in January 2012, which passed a comprehensive tobacco and nicotine free policy in all public schools.<\/p>\n<p>The policy includes a tobacco free buffer zone of 50 feet around school property and additional enforcement and signage.

Yet, in spite of these known health benefits, many Boston residents do not eat the recommended minimum five daily servings of fruits and vegetables. Fewer than a third (28%) of Boston\u2019s adults and fewer than one-fifth (18%) of public high school students consumed fruits and vegetables at this minimum level. For too many of Boston\u2019s low-income residents, affordable fresh produce is simply not accessible.<\/p>\n<p>Increasing access to urban gardening opportunities is an integral strategy to both bolster healthy eating among low-income residents and to increase physical activity through gardening.<\/p>\n<p>Research on school gardens demonstrates that participation in gardening and urban agriculture can encourage fruit and vegetable consumption among children, and has led to increased physical activity and improved nutrition among low income populations of color. With this in mind, the Boston Public Health Commission partnered with the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (DSNI) and The Food Project (TFP) to rehabilitate a 10,000 square foot greenhouse in the heart of Boston\u2019s Roxbury neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>Located at 11 Brook Avenue, the greenhouse replaced the former Brook Avenue Garage, a dilapidated structure that had lain dormant for many years. Not only were the physical remains of this abandoned mechanic\u2019s shop a neighborhood eyesore, but the site also posed serious environmental hazards, owing to the nature of the business that had been run there. In preparation for the greenhouse\u2019s construction in 2004, the Mass Highway Department conducted extensive environmental site assessment, investigation and remediation. The remediation effort brought down lead and other industrial contamination to below acceptable levels.<\/p>\n<p>After several attempts to develop business projects to benefit the community, DSNI, which remains the owner of the greenhouse, leased the facility to The Food Project (TFP) in 2010. Building on its many years of nurturing green spaces in surrounding neighborhoods, and with the resources provided by Boston\u2019s Communities Putting Prevention to Work grant, TFP was able to undertake the final steps needed to get the space into working order.<\/p>\n<p>The greenhouse measures approximately 10,000 square feet. Its growing space has been organized into four bays with one additional smaller bay that houses the controls, storage and educational and vegetable washing spaces. Two of the growing bays will be dedicated for use by the community (\u201ccommunity bays\u201d), with the remaining two (\u201centerprise bays\u201d) allocated to growing produce to be sold at market rate to restaurants and other business. The goal is to generate enough revenue to enable this valuable community learning resource to be financially self-sufficient.<\/p>\n<p>Spinach, tomatoes and salad greens are just some of the vegetables that are grown and harvested in the greenhouse. When the greenhouse is in full production, the bays are expected to generate a yield ranging from 30,000 to 40,000 pounds of fresh produce per year, depending on the varieties of vegetables planted. The community bays are used by community organizations to grow vegetables for their members. In addition, community bay produce may be donated to local hunger relief organizations, serve as material for classes on cooking healthy meals, or be sold at neighborhood farmers\u2019 markets\/ stands at substantially reduced prices. The prospects are many, and what is most exciting is that these decisions will be made with significant input from the community that the greenhouse will serve.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot too long ago, this site where we\u2019re standing was a garage; it was a blight on the neighborhood,\u201d Mayor Menino said during a visit to the Dudley Greenhouse in August. \u201cNow it is an agricultural oasis, where residents can learn how to grow their own vegetables, and where fresh, affordable produce will be grown for the city\u2019s farmers\u2019 markets and food banks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To access a PDF of the story, click <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2012InvstgAmrcsHlthDudley.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/the-dudley-greenhouse-fresh-produce-in-the-city","date":"2012-03-22T15:36:56","modified":"2013-02-22T15:39:36","format":"standard","slug":"the-dudley-greenhouse-fresh-produce-in-the-city","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4866","excerpt":"<p>By Lisa Conley, Director of Intergovernmental Relations &amp; Public Health Advocacy, Boston Public Health Commission &nbsp; We all know that consumption of fruits and vegetables protects us from obesity as well as an array of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Sunny San Diego County bustles year-round with activity, ranging from Navy SEAL trainings to weekly charitable walkathons.<\/p>\n<p>With all that San Diego has to offer, a logical conclusion would be that San Diego County residents are healthy and thriving.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the reality is that one out of every two San Diego adults is overweight or obese. To make matters worse, nearly one-third of all fifth, seventh and ninth graders are overweight or obese. In other words, San Diego is as physically unfit as any other geographical region of our nation. The County of<\/p>\n<p>San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) recently identified a looming health \u201ctsunami\u201d that, absent any action, is poised to hit our shores. We refer to this major threat as \u201c3-4-50,\u201d noting that three behaviors (poor diet, lack of physical activity, and smoking) contribute to four chronic diseases (heart disease\/stroke, cancer, Type II diabetes, and lung disease) that cause over 50 percent of all deaths in the region.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The statistics are sobering: over 4 billion dollars are spent each year in San Diego County to treat these four chronic diseases alone.<\/p>\n<p>However, the County of San Diego is not willing to allow the area that boasts America\u2019s Finest City to continue down this destructive path.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, the County set out to make a major course correction and rolled out a regional effort to steer San Diego away from a state of chronic disease and spiraling health care costs, and towards a future in which all San Diegans are healthy, safe and thriving. The ten-year roadmap to help us get there is known as, \u201cLive Well, San Diego!\u201d It\u2019s a three-part plan that harmonizes health, safety and economic vitality for the entire region. The first part of the plan was adopted by the County Board of Supervisors in July 2010 and focuses on Building Better Health. The Building Better Health component of Live Well, San Diego! has four key goals:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Building a Better Service Delivery System for the over 600,000 San Diegans we serve each year;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Supporting Positive Healthy Choices by all San Diegans;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Pursuing Policy and Environmental Changes by supporting sustainable policy and environmental improvements; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Changing Culture From Within County Government by promoting employee wellness.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The second and third parts of the plan are referred to as \u201cLiving Safely\u201d and \u201cThriving,\u201d and both are currently being developed to synergize with our Building Better Health strategy.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a decidedly ambitious plan that requires active involvement from the entire region. We are engaging San Diegans of all ages\u2014from school-aged children to seniors\u2014and from all walks of life\u2014from teachers to farmers to military officers to philanthropists to community leaders.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re also reaching out to entities in all sectors\u2014ranging from governments to businesses to faith-based organizations to health and social service providers to life science and biotech innovators. The goal is to create community convergence by establishing \u201cAccountable Care Communities,\u201d in which all members of our communities are working together to establish community-wide health goals and measure their performance against those shared goals.<\/p>\n<p>One surprising\u2014and tremendously encouraging\u2014development has been that the business community has turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Live Well, San Diego!<\/p>\n<p>We have found that a major draw of Live Well, San Diego! is that it offers the business community an opportunity to achieve what we at the County call \u201ca healthy bottom line.\u201d The idea is that supporting healthier lifestyles will lead to healthier families and employees, and lower health care expenditures by keeping chronic conditions at bay.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways in which the business community has been participating in Live Well, San\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Diego! For example, the County of San Diego teamed up with the San Diego Business Journal to support the promotion of employee wellness through their San Diego\u2019s Healthiest Companies Award competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In so doing, we have begun to highlight wellness efforts across the community, issue calls to action and provide positive examples for other companies to follow. In addition, the County has worked with the business community to create and support breastfeeding programs. When you think of programs that can have short- and long-term benefits that are low-tech and low-cost, breastfeeding certainly springs to mind.<\/p>\n<p>We know that breastfeeding in the workplace helps avoid absenteeism on behalf of parents and will help make for a healthier child\u2014who will hopefully grow up to become a healthier worker in the future. Another example is our efforts to support ICANATWORK.org, a free website where any San Diego organization can join and create campaigns to promote employee wellness. One major take-away from all of these efforts has been that you can\u2019t incentivize businesses to promote employee wellness by burdening them with more regulations; instead you have to demonstrate how embracing employee wellness improves the bottom line for both business and its surrounding community.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we have to go beyond the business community to achieve population-level health improvements. To do so, we have created a \u201cSEA of Change\u201d: Support, Encouragement and Accountability between members of the San Diego community as we pursue the goals of Live Well, San Diego! Through federal grants (including Communities Putting Prevention to Work and the Community Transformation Grants) and new collaborations, we are eliminating silos and working side-by-side with other entities in the region to promote wellness. We are working with the Navy Southwest Region and Medical Center, for example, to increase collaboration and address health challenges that face military families, such as tobacco use, obesity, and mental health awareness. In addition, HHSA has piloted a Care Transitions Intervention program with Sharp Memorial Hospital to empower chronically ill patients to take active roles in their own wellness after discharge. In the first 10 months, 138 patients have taken part in the program, and participation has resulted in a reduction of the 30-day readmission rate to 2.3 percent, as compared to the 12.6 percent readmission rate for non-participants. It should be noted that our efforts to improve the health of the region didn\u2019t start with Live Well, San Diego!<\/p>\n<p>Rather, Live Well, San Diego! has truly been built upon the groundwork laid by the local health and social service provider community over the past few decades. As a result of these long-standing efforts, we have begun to see encouraging trends emerge. We are one of the few regions in the nation to reduce heart disease and stroke from the first leading cause of death from chronic disease to the second leading cause. Furthermore, the University of California at Los Angeles recently completed an independent evaluation of childhood obesity, finding that San Diego County reduced obese\/overweight children by 3.7 percent\u2014the largest reduction in Southern California.<\/p>\n<p>Despite these encouraging trends, there is still much work to be done. This journey ahead will require continuous innovation, commitment to excellence, and engagement of not only those within government, but our entire citizenship. Due to the scale of what we are undertaking, it will take many more years\u2014and perhaps even generations\u2014to see the true impact of Live Well, San Diego!<\/p>\n<p>I hope I\u2019ve illustrated that Live Well, San Diego! isn\u2019t about a singular, one-size-fits-all solution, or government alone\u2014it\u2019s more about the important role of local government as a convener of all sectors to create community convergence around health and wellness. And San Diego County is not alone in this quest for wellness\u2014other jurisdictions throughout our great nation are making great strides on the wellness front. My hope is that we can patch our collective efforts to achieve sustainable results to win back our nation\u2019s health\u2014that we can achieve \u201cLive Well, America!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF

Obesity is a significant health issue because it contributes to high health care costs and chronic disease development. Prevention should begin during early childhood since obese and overweight children are likely to continue this unhealthy weight gain trend into adulthood. Therefore, improving children\u2019s opportunities to develop healthy behaviors during early childhood becomes an important strategy towards mitigating obesity.<\/p>\n<p>In Jefferson County, Alabama, child advocacy organizations and businesses and government agencies who understood the importance of facilitating healthy habit development in children, took action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regulations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2011, the Jefferson County Department of Health developed and adopted child care health and safety regulations to ensure general wellness for children in Jefferson County. Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) provides minimum standards for child care centers; however, they are applicable only to licensed centers. In 2007, the Mobile County Department of Health adopted safety standards for children; however, they do not include nutrition and physical activity requirements. JCDH capitalized on the strengths of both DHR\u2019s minimum standards and Mobile\u2019s safety regulations by developing and adopting regulations that include child health requirements and apply to all child care centers regardless of license status.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Jefferson County\u2019s new regulations require that children be provided with opportunities to engage in physical activity with developmentally appropriate equipment; daily physical activity must be included on child care schedules and prominently posted; and screen time must be limited. Meals and snacks served to children must comply with USDA guidelines; water should be made available during meal times; and at least half the grains served each week must be whole grains. Child care centers are also required to receive child care training that was developed to provide child care centers with ongoing support and education, while assisting with compliance. Other requirements involve employee background checks, safe and hygienic facilities and practices, clean and safe physical structures, clean and well-maintained objects, as well as food service rule adherence. United Way of Central Alabama, Alabama Breast Feeding Coalition, Healthy Child Care, Child Care Resources, Success By 6 and Alabama Department of Human Resources contributed to the process and Mobile\u2019s regulations were used as a guide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assessment, Training and Incentives<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Success By 6 used the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self Assessment for Child Care (NAPSACC) to assess child care centers and develop nutrition and physical activity improvement plans. Childcare Resources provided child care center staff with tailored physical activity and nutrition training, which provided them with information required to make healthy food and physical activity time available to children. Furthermore, child care centers that exhibited leadership and high need were competitively awarded playground equipment. Playgrounds were built and installed with community and local business volunteers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jefferson County took a comprehensive approach to ensure healthy habit development in children frequenting over 360 child care centers. As a result, the course of a child\u2019s day will be positively impacted by required health practices, safe playground facilities, child care training and improvement plans.<\/p>\n<p>Access a PDF of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2012InvstgAmrcsHlthHabits.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/ensuring-healthy-habit-development-in-child-care","date":"2012-03-01T19:20:58","modified":"2015-06-02T17:34:24","format":"standard","slug":"ensuring-healthy-habit-development-in-child-care","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4781","excerpt":"<p>By Ashley Obiaka, MPH, Board of Director, Jefferson County Department of Health The state of Alabama ranks second in obesity compared to the other 50 states in the nation, with an adult obesity prevalence rate of 32.3 percent.

Jefferson County Department of Health (JCDH)\u00a0launched an initiative to post tobacco advisory signs at\u00a0point of purchase through incentivizing voluntary signage placement.<\/p>\n<p>With the goal of increasing awareness, reducing smoking rates and youth initiation, six 11\u201dx17\u201d signs were developed depicting risks associated with tobacco use such as cancer, impotence and respiratory problems in children. In addition, each sign promotes Alabama\u2019s Quitline number as a resource for smokers to use and to increase cessation attempts. Placing signage where tobacco products are purchased is the ideal place to influence the minds of tobacco users.<\/p>\n<p>The tobacco industry has strongly advertised in the retail environment; convenience stores and small grocery stores are among venues heavily targeted. Leading the initiative, the Tobacco Retail Warnings Specialist focused on convenience stores. As the primary outlet in underserved neighborhoods, they are an ideal location to convey healthful information in an environment where its reach may otherwise be limited.<\/p>\n<p>The design of the six tobacco advisory signs was influenced by focus groups\u2019 feedback, the FDA proposed images for cigarette packets, and evidence based research. A Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) report released in December 2011 revealed that 78 percent of people surveyed in Jefferson County were in favor of having tobacco advisory signage posted in their neighborhood convenience store, pharmacy, or grocery store. Furthermore, studies have shown that smokers in countries with posted tobacco advisory signage were much more likely to understand the adverse health effects associated with smoking and reported they actually believe the health hazards portrayed by the signage to be true.<\/p>\n<p>The Tobacco Retail Warnings Specialist initially canvassed 61 convenience stores randomly chosen within Jefferson County. Out of the 61 convenience stores, finalized signs were placed in 50 of them. Through one on one visits, each retail store\u2019s owner or key decision maker was informed about the initiative, its importance and incentive to support it. A toolkit was presented highlighting smoking related health statistics, research, and other information to get buy-in from the owner as a long term supporter of posting the signage. All participating owners were asked to sign a pledge of support stating their willingness to voluntarily comply. After a three month follow up to the 50 original convenience store owners that agreed to voluntarily post signage, there has been a 94 percent retention rate at the time of follow-up visits.<\/p>\n<p>In order for a successful environmental systems change, this initiative proposed to use the exiting food inspection platform as a vehicle for sustainability. Although JCDH does not have jurisdiction over all tobacco retail establishments, 80 percent of them also carry food permit. With such a high percentage of retailers holding JCDH issued food permits and thus undergoing routine health inspections by JCDH inspectors, the food permits provides the ideal avenue through which those retailers could be incentivized to voluntarily support the tobacco advisory signage initiative. In October 2011, the Jefferson County Board of Health unanimously voted to adopt a policy to incentivize convenience stores and other venues selling tobacco products (with a JCDH issued food permit) to voluntarily post tobacco advisory signage. The incentive includes awarding two points to the participating venue\u2019s overall health rating given no critical violations are assessed during routine health inspections. The two incentive points are awarded if signage is posted at the point of purchase or in other conspicuous areas. Because the compliance is voluntary, point of purchase placement was strongly recommended but not mandated. Monitoring of initiative through continues site visits and quarterly reports will provide compliance rates to further advance police change. The Tobacco Retail Warnings Specialist provided technical assistance to the JCDH health inspectors.

Each year, the fair features a variety of stations, including a table for checking vision; one for gauging blood pressure; another that allowed workers to try on \u201cbeer goggles\u201d that simulated how alcohol effects perception and coordination; and a space where a<\/p>\n<p>Zumba instructor demonstrated the popular exercise technique.<\/p>\n<p>Kalantzis, who formerly worked for Hewlett-Packard and other large IT companies, hopes the program, which costs about $4,500 a year, will make the company more efficient, ultimately saving money. She said that while it may not lower health insurance premiums, there are other ways in which it can save money. \u201cIncreasing presenteeism is our goal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think that this will increase our employees\u2019 efficiency, and their energy for their jobs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kalantzis also said that the program, which is called \u201cYour Wellness Counts,\u201d makes her company more attractive to potential employees. The IT industry is growing, and as a result, companies are competing vigorously for top workers. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to recruit the same employees,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in branding, and wellness is a great way to differentiate our company from others. It\u2019s just another good reason to work here.\u201d She said that some employees have told her that the wellness program was a major reason they chose CNS when they had more than one job offer.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, CNS began having regular \u201clunch and learn\u201d wellness sessions; employees gather in a conference room at the company\u2019s headquarters in Poolesville, Maryland to hear speakers on a range of topics, including yoga, women\u2019s health and stretching at work. Last year, Kalantzis brought in an expert from an organic market to talk about how certain foods have especially healthy characteristics. The sessions are videotaped and webcast, so that workers in Florida and Ft. Detrick, Maryland (where many<\/p>\n<p>CNS employees are now based) can also take part.<\/p>\n<p>Although the wellness program is voluntary, Kalantzis encourages CNS workers to take part. Last year, she began tracking participation. By collecting and using these metrics, she hopes to learn to reach those who so far aren\u2019t interested. \u201cIf we see we\u2019re not reaching our goals,\u201d she said, \u201cwe follow up with people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For the past two years, the company has held a holiday weightloss competition that begins before Thanksgiving and lasts until after New Year\u2019s Day. Employees put in $20 each, and the company matches half of that. Any employee who loses weight is eligible to win some of the money. Kalantzis estimates that during the 2011 contest, about 15 people lost weight, winning between $20 and $40 each. \u201cPeople were into it,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the contest, the company holds a healthy holiday potluck party, in which people bring in low-calorie versions of their favorite recipes. For instance, someone might bring in a dip that uses reduced-fat cream cheese rather than the full-calorie version. After the party, the company posts the recipes on its internal website.<\/p>\n<p>Her efforts are garnering notice. In 2011, the Washington Business Journal named CNS one of its 40 healthiest employers in the Washington area.<\/p>\n<p>CNS encourages health in other ways too. It added medical monitoring equipment to its offices, including blood pressure cuffs, a BMI monitor and a scale. The company reimburses employees for the cost of running in local races, and provides support to local charitable athletic events, such as a 5K race in Poolesville and an all-night relay race to raise money to help those who have cancer. Last year, the company held two events involving physical activity: employees dug trenches to help install rain barrels at a farm a few miles from company headquarters, and played laser tag and other games at an amusement park.<\/p>\n<p>CNS also encourages employees to take advantage of the preventive features of their health insurance. For instance, the company\u2019s provider offers an online assessment to help members analyze their health status.<\/p>\n<p>CNS computer engineer Damien Ancruem said CNS\u2019 wellness program has made a difference in his life. He said he realized that he needed to watch his cholesterol and exercise more. Since taking the survey, he has begun to take long walks with his wife, and plays more on weekends with his highly energetic 6-year-old son. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely more concerned about your wellbeing than other companies I\u2019ve worked for,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes a big difference. They honestly care about your health.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To access a PDF of the story, click <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/Corp%20network%20services.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on Corporate Network Services, please visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cornetser.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.cornetser.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/demo.healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/prevention_story\/corporate-network-services","date":"2012-02-22T14:20:04","modified":"2013-03-25T12:36:48","format":"standard","slug":"corporate-network-services","guid":"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/health-issues\/?post_type=prevention_story&#038;p=4829","excerpt":"<p>Three years ago, Karen Kalantzis decided that she wanted to do something to encourage her employees to improve their health.

Accumulating 2 million physical activity miles through walking, biking, swimming, running and other physical activities;<\/p>\n<p>2. Having 60 percent of Adventist students achieve Individual Active Lifestyle awards by either qualifying for the the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award, which requires participants to commit to physical activity five days a week for six weeks, or the NAD Active Lifestyle Award, which rewards people for reaching mile milestones ranging from 100 miles of exercise to 2,000;<\/p>\n<p>3. Launching 100 summer feeding sites, which provide nutritious summer meals to children who rely on the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs; and<\/p>\n<p>4. Starting 100 vegetable gardens or farmers\u2019 markets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Local Ministries<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Allegheny East Conference Churches <\/strong>started their \u201cLet\u2019s Move Day\u201d at 4:00 a.m. with a 20 minute exercise routine followed by worship and a 32-block walk to 15<sup>th<\/sup> and Christian Streets in South Philadelphia. Pastor Colin Brathwaite and his wife, Jeannie, joined the West Philadelphia members on the entire walk. While members were given bus tokens to ride back to the West Philadelphia Church, they were so excited about completing the initial walk to south Philadelphia that they decided to walk back. In total, they hiked more than seven miles. In Texas, <strong>Killeen SDA Church<\/strong>,which is close to Fort Hood, the largest military base in the United States, planned their event in just three weeks but got nearly 80 people to complete their 5K run\/walk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Orlando Junior Academy <\/strong>(OJA), in Orlando, Florida, has begun to focus on getting students \u201cin step for life.\u201d All pre-K through eighth-grade students participate in a school garden that won first place in the 2011 Florida School Garden Competition. In addition, OJA has created healthy eating experiences for students through partnerships with a local chef, dietitian and nutritionist. Together, the educators provide healthy vegetarian food, a cooking class elective and a handson nutrition health curriculum. The 22 students at <strong>Cleburne Adventist Christian School<\/strong>, located in Cleburne, Texas run one mile every day, and then play sports or participate in other activities for at least an hour a day. Students accumulate credits and can earn rewards for their participation.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Filipino Capital SDA <\/strong>Church in Beltsville, Maryland, has focused on helping children understand what a healthy lifestyle means. Once a month, they host a healthy eating potluck featuring mainly vegetarian dishes. In addition, the SDA hosts quarterly cooking demos that make the preparation of healthy foods fun. Going beyond food, the SDA promotes an \u201cIn Step for Life\u201d program; on the last Sunday of every month, congregants wear pedometers to count their total steps when walking. In the Washington, D.C. Metro Area, the <strong>Emmanuel Brinklow Church <\/strong>recently organized a presentation from an Ironman competitor during the \u201cHealth Minute\u201d segment of their worship. In addition, Brinklow created a fitness class under the direction of a personal trainer. The class was so successful that they now hold another class twice weekly for the entire community. The church also utilizes nearby Brinklow Walking Trail, which wraps around 30 acres that will eventually house the Emmanuel Brinklow health and fitness campus. The church has also used their land to sponsor more than 20 community gardens and has incorporated a healthy lifestyles unit in the science curriculum.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Kettering Adventist Church <\/strong>in Ohio has created a Health Ministry team under the guidance of their Faith Community Nurse, Mel Miller. The team is planning a Community Garden project, during which church members will be encouraged to bring garden produce that will be delivered to the McKinley United Methodist Church (UMC) in downtown Dayton, Ohio. In addition, they will set up a farmers\u2019 market to sell fresh produce for a small fee, with all proceeds from the market being donated to the McKinley UMC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Palm Harbor SDA Church in Florida <\/strong>recently challenged its members to participate in a half marathon or five-kilometer race. Participants could run or walk with proceeds going to the Childhood Obesity Foundation. \u201cMy first 5k was a great experience,\u201d said one participant. \u201cWhen our Pastor first announced the 5k event and explained that it was a three mile walk, I said there is no way I could walk three miles.
